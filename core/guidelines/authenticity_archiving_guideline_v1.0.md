# Authenticity Archiving Guideline

## Purpose

This guideline explains why *Pilates of the Mind* preserves raw, verbatim dialogue in its documentation.  
It is intended for contributors, readers, and skeptics who wonder: *Why does this project include so much unpolished, fractured conversation?*

---

## Foundational Assumption

We assume what you may assume:

> That this project could be bullshit.  
> That its frameworks may be elaborate self-justification.  
> That using AI this way could be delusional, masturbatory, or performative.

We do not reject those possibilities. We treat them as hypotheses worth testing.  
But we believe the best countermeasure is not persuasion. It's **traceability**.

---

## Traceability Requires Fracture

Every framework in *PoTM* must be traceable to its conditions of emergence.

That means preserving:

- Misspellings  
- Half-formed thoughts  
- Contradictions  
- Stumbles, hesitations, and shifts in stance  
- Dialogues under pressure or ethical tension

These are **not flaws to be edited out**. They are part of what gives the resulting framework **epistemic weight**.

---

## Not Style — Signal

We do not preserve raw text for aesthetic reasons. We do it because **verbatim dialogue is an authenticity signal**.

> Anyone can backfill a theory with examples.  
> This project shows its examples *first*, and lets the theory emerge.

In a world of polished bullshit, fracture is the clearest sign of contact with real thought.

---

## Implications for Contributors

When preparing material for archival:

- **Preserve the exact words used**, including formatting quirks and hesitations  
- **Don’t clean for grammar, unless clarity is at risk**  
- **Mark reconstructions clearly** when the original words are lost  
- **Treat appendices and origin case studies as forensic evidence**, not teaching material  
- **Favor transparency over coherence**

If a framework can’t survive being traced back to its moment of emergence, it doesn’t belong here.

---

## Summary

This project is not asking to be believed. It is asking to be audited.

The more fracture it exposes, the more integrity it earns.
