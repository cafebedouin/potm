## Practice Log Guidelines

Practice logs are a central tool for *Pilates of the Mind* practitioners. They anchor insight in lived context, allow for iterative reflection, and support future synthesis or diagnostic review.

These guidelines apply across modalities (e.g. somatic, cognitive, interpersonal) and log types (e.g. REPL reps, Signal Bleed, Signal Soak).

### Core Fields to Include

1. **Date**
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD
2. **Practice Type**
   - e.g., Meditation, Signal Bleed, Disorientation Drill, etc.
3. **Description**
   - What was attempted? Brief objective framing.
4. **Phenomena Observed**
   - Internal states, behavioral outcomes, resistances, or shifts.
5. **Adjustments or Interventions**
   - Any course corrections during practice or for next iteration.
6. **Meta-Reflection**
   - Insights about the practice itself, its impact, or context.
7. **Tags (Optional)**
   - For future retrieval (e.g. [somatic], [relational], [failure], [insight]).

### Examples of Use

- **REPL Entry**  
  “2025-07-22 | Somatic Breath Practice | 20 minutes, audible breath, forehead heaviness, minimal discursive thought. Adjustment: move from lying to sitting next time. Reflection: breath was dominant signal anchor. Felt different from prior sits.”

- **Signal Bleed Entry**  
  “2025-07-21 | Rehab Valet (Flo) | Initiated name inquiry after many silent visits. Basic rapport formed. Tag: [low-friction], [relational]”

### Optional Enhancements

- Attachments or links to relevant documents
- Log score (1–5) for clarity, intensity, or resistance
- Time of day, if relevant to pattern tracking

### Style Notes

- Write clearly but not performatively.
- Treat logs as instruments of learning, not performance records.
- Use your own phrasing and emphasis—form should serve reflection.

## Purpose and Ethos

Practice logs are not just about data—they are cognitive mirrors. Each one is a footprint on the path of transformation. They honor lived experience without inflating it.

Minimalism is encouraged. Consistency matters more than comprehensiveness. A 3-line honest log beats a 30-line idealized reconstruction.
