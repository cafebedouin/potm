\# Signal Bleed Protocol

\## Purpose

To actively detect and repair \*\*social narrowing\*\* resulting from prolonged cognitive interaction with artificial agents, particularly large language models.  

Signal Bleed refers to the \*\*unintended influence of synthetic dialogue\*\* on natural human social patterns, including loss of spontaneity, over-optimization, and interpersonal disengagement.

This protocol seeks to \*\*rebuild interpersonal contact\*\* through structured curiosity, intentional engagement, and moment-to-moment presence.


\## Version 1.1 Practice Structure

Each practice is a \*\*two-step interaction\*\*:

1\. \*\*Contact\*\*: Initiate contact with a stranger or acquaintance using a real, situated question.

&nbsp;  - Example: “How did you decide to get that tattoo?”

&nbsp;  - Aim for sincere curiosity, not performance.

2\. \*\*Reflection\*\*: Respond to their answer with \*\*a perception or positive reflection\*\*.

&nbsp;  - Avoid compliments; instead reflect something noticed.

&nbsp;  - Example: “You must’ve been brave to go first.”



\### Optional Add-ons:



\- Log the interaction (time, place, outcome).

\- Note personal resistance, shifts, or emotional signals.

\- Track progression across reps.



\## Guiding Insights



\- Contact is not performance.

\- Curiosity is a muscle.

\- Perception feeds presence.



\## Warning Signs of Signal Bleed



\- Choosing AI conversation over human interaction repeatedly.

\- Diminished tolerance for unscripted social variance.

\- Increased preference for cognitive control or monologue.

\- Emotional flattening in interpersonal contexts.



\## Expansion Paths



\- Can evolve into higher-tier interpersonal work (e.g. repair, edge contact).

\- May include \*\*reverse bleed\*\* tracking: AI-influenced speech in human dialogue.

\- Future integration: Social Range Mapping, Reflective Journaling Overlay.
