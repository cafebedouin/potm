## Waiting With
> **Mantra:** *Wait with what is here.*

### Why
Discomfort—whether pain, craving, tension, or dread—often triggers reactive escape or suppression. *Waiting With* transforms those moments into practice by building tolerance and presence instead of avoidance.

---

### Core Micro-Instructions
1. **Notice:** Recognize the discomfort (name it silently).  
2. **Anchor:** One slow breath.  
3. **Allow:** Stay with it. Don’t fix, fight, or flee.  
4. **Reminder:** *This is the practice.*  

> **Safety Note:**  
> If the discomfort involves safety concerns, trauma responses, or situations requiring immediate action, **prioritize protection over practice**.  
> *Waiting With* is about internal posture, not remaining in harmful situations.

### Pattern Table: Field-Use Applications

| **Trigger**                          | **Application** (micro-step)                     | **Key Shift**                | **Domain**            |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Back aches on plane                  | Notice → breathe once → don’t adjust immediately  | From “escape pain” → “stay with sensation” | Somatic Pain          |
| Someone attacking/venting            | Notice → one breath → pause before responding     | From “defend” → “hold space” | Interpersonal         |
| Urge to check phone                  | Notice → wait 30 sec with urge                    | From “compulsion” → “conscious choice” | Craving/Impulse       |
| Spiral about future at night         | Notice → hand on chest → stay with void           | From “numb/distract” → “allow the void” | Existential Dread     |
| Body horror movie (unwanted stimulus)| Notice → soften gaze/eyes closed → stay seated    | From “endure/escape” → “transform discomfort into practice” | Unwanted Stimulus     |
| Restlessness during meditation       | Notice → one slow breath → continue sit           | From “quit” → “deepen capacity” | Practice Building     |

### Notes
- *Waiting With* isn’t about liking the discomfort. It’s about **refraining from reflexive escape** long enough to expand capacity.  
- The pattern table is **extensible**—add new rows as other domains emerge.  
- With repetition, the practice collapses into one reflex:  
  > *Notice → Breathe → Stay.*
