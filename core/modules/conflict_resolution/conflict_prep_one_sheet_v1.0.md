# 🧭 Conflict Prep One-Sheet (v1.0)
*A short guide to help you handle a hard conversation well*

**Use when:** You’re upset or something feels off, and you need to talk to someone about it soon.  
**Goal:** Stay grounded, speak clearly, and keep the door open for repair—even if things stay tense.

## ✅ Step 1: Check Yourself First

Before you talk to them:

- ❓ Are you *too angry, tired, or upset* to think straight?
  - 🕊️ If yes, take a break: walk, breathe, write it out.
- 🪞 Ask: *What do I want from this talk?*  
  - To be heard? To set a boundary? To fix something?

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Hold Your Story Lightly

You may have strong feelings—but remember:

- What you feel is real.  
- But what you *think it means* might not be right.

Try this mindset:  
> “Here’s how it seemed to me… but I want to hear how it looked to you.”

---

## 🛡️ Step 3: Is It Safe to Talk?

Use this fast check:

- Are they someone who usually listens, even if it’s hard?
- Are you free to say what you mean without getting punished?
- Are you both in a space where you can focus (not rushed or distracted)?

**If no:** wait, find support, or write them instead.

## 🗣️ Step 4: Choose How to Start

Pick one of these simple openings:

- 🟢 “Can we talk about something that’s been on my mind?”
- 🟡 “Something felt off between us—can I check what happened?”
- 🔵 “I may be missing something, but I wanted to share how it looked from my side.”

Stay calm. Speak slowly. Use “I” statements. Example:

> “I felt left out during that meeting. I’m not sure if it was meant that way, but it hit hard.”

## 🔀 Step 5: Choose What You Need Most

After you’ve spoken, you have a few good options:

### A. 🧩 Mutual Repair  
You talk it through, both share, both grow.  
Use if: They’re open and there’s trust.

### B. 🛑 Respectful Exit  
You name what’s not working and step back kindly.  
Use if: You’ve tried and it’s not getting better.

### C. 🔄 Personal Integration  
You choose not to engage fully—but reflect and learn.  
Use if: Now’s not the time, or it’s not worth it.

All are valid. You’re not a bad person for choosing distance if connection isn’t safe.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Blaming or assuming bad intent
- ❌ Trying to “win” or be right

- ❌ Avoiding hard talks *forever*

---

## 💡 Final Reminders

- *You can’t control their reaction—but you can control your tone, timing, and truthfulness.*
- *Start small if needed. A little repair can go a long way.*
- *You don’t have to fix everything today.*

---

**Time Check:** This whole prep takes **15–30 minutes.**  
Even 5 minutes of slowing down can help you avoid making it worse.
