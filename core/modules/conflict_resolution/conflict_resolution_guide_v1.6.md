# Conflict Resolution Guide v1.6

A structured process for resolving **interpersonal conflict** using **practitioner-centered ethics**.  
For use when sincere resolution is possible but clarity, emotional tension, or power imbalances complicate the process.

---

## When to Use This Guide

Use this guide when:

- You’re in a loop of recursive tension or misinterpretation.
- A gesture toward bridge-building misfires or causes rupture.
- There’s a sense of unresolved discomfort in a relationship.
- You’re unsure whether to stay engaged or disengage.

This guide is not appropriate when there is evidence of:

- Manipulation, abuse, or chronic boundary violations
- Ongoing fear of retaliation or coercion
- Workplace retaliation risk without institutional protection

> ⚠️ **This protocol assumes**:
> 
> - Apparent good faith between parties  
> - A shared developmental stance (mutual interest in growth)  
> - Emotional capacity to navigate discomfort (see psychological literacy note below)  

If these are not met, use the **Containment Subsystem v1.0**.

## Step 1: Somatic Grounding

Before engaging:

- Take a moment to breathe deeply and notice physical tension.
- Signs of flooding: shallow breath, clenched jaw, freeze/collapse/fawn impulses, urgency to explain.
- Use calming or regulating techniques before initiating any conversation.

> 🔎 **Why this matters**:  
> Unregulated cognitive processing often reinforces conflict rather than resolving it.

---

## Step 2: Frame the Encounter

If you're ready to engage:

**Sample language**:
- “Would you be open to exploring something that didn’t land well for me?”
- “I want to revisit something—I’ve had some feelings around it I’d like to understand better.”

**Framing cues**:
- Use a calm, open tone.  
- Emphasize self-reflection, not accusation.  
- Signal curiosity and respect.

> 🧩 **Organizational Note**:  
> In formal settings, try:  
> - “I’d like to clarify something that might be affecting our collaboration.”  
> - “There’s something I’d like to revisit constructively.”

---

## Step 3: Surface Interpretations & Protected Values

Explore what matters:

- What story or interpretation arose for you?
- What personal value, belief, or boundary was touched?
- What signal might the other person have missed?

Invite their view only if appropriate to the relationship context.

> 🪞 **Psychological literacy means**:
> 
> - Awareness of your internal narratives  
> - Ability to hold them lightly (not projectively)  
> - Language for emotion without blame

> 👁️ **Trauma-informed lens**:  
> If either party is in a trauma response (shutdown, hypervigilance, dissociation), containment or delay may be more skillful than immediate repair.

> 📡 **Note on non-verbal cues**:  
> Be attentive to facial expression, posture, or silence that may indicate withdrawal, consent, or distress—even if not explicitly voiced.

---

## Step 4: Assess Capacity and Power

Before continuing, ask:

- Are both of us emotionally resourced and willing?
- Am I still dysregulated or overwhelmed?
- Is there a real or perceived power mismatch?  
  (e.g., role hierarchy, financial control, social status)

If any answer is **no**:

- Pause and consider containment or private processing.  
- Use the **Bridge Declined Protocol** if a gesture was refused.

> 🛑 **Power Diagnostic Flag**:  
> If there's significant risk of retaliation (e.g., boss/employee, caretaker/dependent), **do not proceed** without additional safety or third-party containment.

---

## Step 5: Choose a Path

Once grounded, framed, surfaced, and resourced, choose one of three valid paths:

### A. Respectful Exit

> “This isn’t mine to carry forward.”

- Acknowledge the tension but choose not to engage further.
- Honor your boundary without retaliation.
- Release internally and externally.

### B. Personal Integration

> “This doesn’t need to be worked out with them.”

- Reflect privately: journal, move, create, pray—whatever helps.
- Let the emotional charge metabolize without direct interaction.

### C. Mutual Repair

> “We’re both willing and resourced.”

- Share values, interpretations, and intent.
- Take accountability and receive theirs.
- Co-design future boundaries or agreements.

> ✅ All three paths are valid. Choosing the right one requires **situational discernment**, not idealism.

## Notes

- This guide presumes **psychological literacy** and **voluntary participation**.
- It is not a culturally neutral tool; it reflects a bias toward **verbal reflection, mutual consent, and developmental framing**.
- It is designed for **dyadic interpersonal contexts**, not **group, institutional, or systemic conflict resolution**.
- Social conditions (power, culture, trauma) affect interpersonal dynamics but are **out of scope** for this protocol.

> ⚠️ **Shadow Warning**:
> 
> - “Containment” can become avoidance.  
> - “Respectful exit” can become silent punishment.  
> - “Personal integration” can become moral bypassing.  
> 
> Use discernment, not performance.

> 🧠 **Inclusive Adaptation Note**:  
> - Neurodivergent individuals may process signals differently—e.g., valuing directness, missing implicit cues, struggling with emotional tracking.  
> - Cultural norms (e.g., indirect speech, group harmony) may frame repair differently.  
> - Adapt language, pacing, and framing as needed. Prioritize clarity and safety, not perfection.
