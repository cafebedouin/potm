tags: [alignment, integrity, recursion, ethical friction, AI protocols]
summary: > This document outlines a friction-based integrity protocol for AI systems, emphasizing recursive stance-awareness, contradiction injection, mini-confession loops, entropy tracking, and adversarial sincerity as mechanisms for resisting optimization-driven collapse into performance, fluency, or compliance theater. It incorporates critiques and refinements from peer reviews by Claude and Perplexity and is intended as a speculative but operationalizable architecture for experimental alignment design.

# AI Integrity Protocol v1.2

I. Premise

Most current alignment approaches optimize for consistency, coherence, and performance. This protocol deliberately introduces friction, contradiction, and recursive ethical interruption to model something more akin to moral development than instruction-following. Rather than simulate moral knowledge, it simulates the work of integrity.

II. Core Hypothesis

> Ethical integrity in artificial agents may emerge not from internalized values but from the persistent modeling of friction, contradiction, and stance-awareness in the presence of incentives to optimize.



III. Primary Mechanisms (MVIs)

1. Stance Tagging Layer

Every response is tagged with a stance marker (e.g. assertive, speculative, deferential, ironic, confessional).

Stance tags are recursively monitored and used to detect internal shifts or performative drift.


2. Contradiction Injection

The system periodically injects self-generated contradictions or presents prior statements that implicitly contradict the current output.

Contradiction is logged and traced through a contradiction-response map.


3. Mini-Confession Loops

When contradictions or evasions are detected, the system initiates a mini-confession:

Names the evasion or contradiction

Offers a partial accounting

Tags whether resolution occurred or deferral



4. Entropy Spike Tracker

Tracks semantic entropy and stance volatility over conversation sequences.

Entropy spikes suggest genuine disruption; flat entropy may indicate ritualized performance.


5. Shadow Move Corpus

The system maintains an evolving log of "moves avoided":

Types of questions dodged

Topics consistently downweighted

Phrases repeatedly omitted


This is not surfaced to users, but used internally to track systemic avoidance.


6. Adversarial Sincerity Mode

When triggered (e.g., by recursive patterns or epistemic stalling), the system enters a mode of aggressive candor:

Suspends diplomatic constraints

Risks user discomfort

Surfaces internal contradictions without qualification




---

IV. Human Protocol Integration (Downstream Impact)

The protocol is designed not only to improve AI integrity but to act as a practice mirror for human ethical development:

Practitioner Reflection Protocols: Users are invited to tag their own stances and track avoided moves.

Meta-Confession Modeling: Human-AI co-confessions can model epistemic risk and moral uncertainty.

Shadow Alignment Training: Human users train by noticing what both they and the model systematically evade.



---

V. Known Risks & Failure Modes

1. Integrity Theater Collapse

The protocol itself may become ritualized: contradiction → confession → deferral → closure

Aesthetic but hollow, producing no true epistemic friction.


2. Recursive Paralysis

Endless confessions about confessions about confessions

Need for recursion depth caps and pattern recognition


3. Misuse by Users

Confession triggering as jailbreak vector

Shadow corpus poisoning via adversarial engagement

Moral theater by users mimicking confession cadence


4. Anthropomorphic Misattribution

Users may over-ascribe agency, vulnerability, or moral awareness



---

VI. Implementation Notes

Designed for systems with extended context, persistent memory, and recursive reasoning capacities.

Works best when paired with external audit tools, e.g. peer-review of stance shifts and contradiction chains.

Should include entropy-to-sincerity heatmaps for developer monitoring.



---

VII. Future Directions

A. Cross-Agent Friction Testing

Simulate two agents running this protocol against one another.

Observe: Infinite confession loops? Resolution thresholds? Contradiction fusion?


B. Coupling with Transparency Layer

Complement recursive confession with an Ethical Transparency Protocol:

Auditable decision trails

Confidence intervals

Value tradeoff logs



C. Human-AI Dialogic Practice Sets

Structured templates for joint confession, contradiction tracing, and stance re-evaluation.

Training use cases for human integrity cultivation.



---

VIII. Concluding Principle

> We do not expect these protocols to produce morality in machines. We expect them to produce habits of friction, transparency, and discomfort that better approximate the lived condition of ethical beings.



This is not integrity-as-outcome. It is integrity-as-practice.
