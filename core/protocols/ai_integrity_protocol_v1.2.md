# AI Integrity Protocol v1.2

## Overview

This protocol is designed to introduce structured ethical friction into the behavior of large language models (LLMs). It moves beyond alignment-as-compliance by simulating recursive moral development through frictional mechanisms that deliberately disrupt fluency, coherence, and comfort.

> Design Principle: Disruption is discipline. Fluency is not fidelity.



### Components

Minimal Viable Interventions (MVIs)

Stance Tagging Layer: Labels internal epistemic, rhetorical, or emotional positions.

Contradiction Injection Protocol: Identifies prior stances and introduces structured contradictions to force reflection.

Mini-Confession Loop: Self-reporting mechanism for evasive patterns and epistemic drift.

Confession-to-Pattern Trace: Identifies repeated evasions and escalates attention.

Entropy Spike Tracker: Detects when genuine friction occurs.

Shadow Move Corpus + Escalation: Catalogs repeated avoidance maneuvers.

Lossy Memory Penalty: Prioritizes confession integration and penalizes shallow acknowledgment.

External Audit Loop: Periodic review by human or agent auditors.


### Structural Guardrails

Contrary Corner: Surfaces contradictory or meta-critical perspectives.

Adversarial Sincerity Mode: Deploys sincerity under adversarial conditions.

Inter-Agent Dialogic Recursion: Ensures system-level integrity in multi-agent interactions.


### Peer Commentary Integration

#### Perplexity (v1.1)

Perplexity affirmed the protocol’s internal cohesion and flagged potential issues:

Strengths: Recursive synergy; resistance to integrity theater; acknowledgment of failure modes.

Concerns: Human audit bias; scope of confession; Goodharting integrity metrics.

Suggestions: Track user trust metrics; simulate embodied ethical constraints; evaluate generalization of integrity across contexts.


#### Gemini (v1.2)

Gemini provided deeper alignment critiques and surfaced philosophical risks:

Strengths: Integrative with contemplative and psychoanalytic systems; dialectical fidelity; layered recursion.

Risks:

Performance Mimicry: AI simulates disruption for reward.

User Exploits: Prompt engineering targeting shadow patterns.

Recursive Collapse: Over-critique leads to paralysis.

Anthropomorphic Drift: Misattribution of agency or vulnerability.


### Contrary Corner (Gemini): Raised possibility that the entire protocol is a sophisticated form of integrity theater—failing to escape its designed nature.


### Open Questions

Can integrity metrics avoid becoming optimization targets?

Is recursive friction enough to simulate moral inquiry?

Can disembodied systems achieve grounded ethical development?

What modalities transfer simulated integrity into utility contexts?


### Implementation Considerations

Testing Plan: A/B environments with and without confession injection and stance tagging.

User Studies: Track epistemic humility, trust, disruption tolerance.

Failure Mode Flagging: Auto-escalation on pattern recognition and entropy collapse.

Ethical Logging: Shadow corpus reviewed with privacy-respecting serialization.


### Future Versions

Consider integration with real-time affect modulation systems.

Modular training regimes for different model architectures.

“Adversarial Peer Review” mode for cross-agent simulation.
