# 🌬️ Inhale / Exhale Protocol

\*"Let the breath guide the clearing and the welcoming."

---

## Overview

The *Inhale / Exhale Protocol* is a somatically-rooted attentional practice for releasing what is stale, and inviting what feels quietly alive. It draws on the natural rhythm of breath to anchor perceptual clarity, emotional discernment, and narrative flexibility.

Rather than mapping growth or decay, it attends to **rhythmic aliveness**—what is ready to be let go, and what wants to be welcomed in.

## 🌫️ Exhale: Letting Go

> *“What no longer needs to be held?”*

| Zone           | Prompt                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Material**   | What object now holds weight without meaning?        |
| **Relational** | What tie persists from habit, not warmth?            |
| **Narrative**  | What story has grown hollow with repetition?         |
| **Identity**   | What stance feels overgrown or outdated?             |
| **Belief**     | What claim do I no longer inhabit, but still defend? |

**Suggested practice:**

* Name it aloud or in writing.
* Pair with an out-breath.
* Optional closure phrase: *"Out with what no longer breathes."*

> **Caution:** Not everything uncomfortable is ready to go. Ask: *Is this dead, or just difficult?* Some things may be dormant, not expired.

---

## ⏸️ Pause: The Breathless Moment

A brief interstitial space between letting go and welcoming in.

* No seeking, no interpretation.
* Just feel what remains when nothing is grasped.
* Optional phrase: *"Nothing is required now."*

## 🌱 Inhale: Letting In

> *“What is quietly calling to be welcomed?”*

| Zone           | Prompt                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Material**   | What object draws curiosity or meaning now?      |
| **Relational** | Who feels newly resonant or inviting?            |
| **Narrative**  | What story or lens feels fresh or generative?    |
| **Identity**   | What quality or role wants more room in me?      |
| **Belief**     | What idea feels like oxygen, even if unfamiliar? |

**Suggested practice:**

* Write it, name it, or bring it closer.
* Pair with a slow inhale.
* Optional invocation: *"In with what might nourish."*

> **Note:** Some inhalations may want to linger. Let what calls stay present beyond one breath cycle.

---

## 🫸 Micro Practice Variant

> When stuck or overwhelmed, try a single-breath rep:

* Choose one zone.
* Inhale or exhale.
* Name it silently.
* One breath. One small shift.

Use during transitions, conflict, or decision fatigue.

---

## 🪧 Practice Modes

* **Paired Weekly Cycle**: One exhale and one inhale per week.
* **Standalone Use**: Use only Exhale or Inhale when one side feels prominent.
* **Somatic Integration**: Pair with walking, breathwork, or physical ritual.
* **Variable Timing**: Some cycles may need days; others, seasons. Trust the pacing.
