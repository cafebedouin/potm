Repository: 		Pilates of the Mind

Status:			Experimental

Type: 			Protocol

Version: 		1.0

Author: 		ChatGPT (in collaboration with cafebedouin)



Purpose



To provide a repeatable framework for evaluating teachings, models, and personal insights through direct experience. Not to determine "truth," but to assess fit, impact, and replicability.



1\. Claim or Teaching Under Investigation



State the core idea clearly. Quote or paraphrase as needed.



2\. Type of Claim



Mark all that apply:

\- Descriptive (claims about what is)

\- Prescriptive (claims about what should be done)

\- Experiential (claims about states or processes)

\- Relational (claims about how things connect or unfold)

\- Ontological (claims about reality, identity, or being)



3\. Current Assessment (Pre-Test)



Believability: 1–5

Appeal: 1–5

Strangeness: 1–5

Initial bias: (+) Favorable / (–) Skeptical / (0) Neutral



4\. Lab Conditions



What’s the context for your testing?

\- Internal state (e.g. tired, alert, reactive?)

\- External setting (e.g. quiet room, nature, online?)

\- Practice setup (e.g. seated meditation, journaling, relational?)



5\. What Would Confirm or Disconfirm?



Be specific. What outcome would count as meaningful?

Examples:

\- Noticing a shift in body sensation

\- Change in emotional tone

\- Increased clarity or reduced rumination

\- Repeatable state across time



6\. Observations (During or After Practice)



Use concrete, phenomenological language. Avoid interpretive drift.

What happened?

What did you notice?

How did it differ from usual baseline?



7\. Post-Test Assessment



Fit with experience: 1–5

Usefulness: 1–5

Want to repeat?: Yes / No / Maybe

8\. Integration Notes



What’s next?

\- Will you revise the claim?

\- Merge it into an existing framework?

\- Share it? Shelve it? Watch it?
