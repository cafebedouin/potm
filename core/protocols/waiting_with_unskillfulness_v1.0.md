# Waiting With Unskillfulness v1.0

> “The skill is not reacting to unskillfulness with more unskillfulness.”

---

## Summary

**Waiting With Unskillfulness** is a containment protocol designed to help practitioners sit with their own or others’ reactive, fragmented, or maladaptive behavior *without escalating it*.

Rather than suppress, avoid, or fix what arises, the practitioner intentionally **waits**—*not passively*, but with attuned attention and minimal interference—until a clearer course of action or insight emerges.

This is a practice of *tending*, not controlling.

---

## Core Moves

1. **Name the unskillfulness** (without judgment)  
   *“This is avoidance.” “That was a defensive jab.”*

2. **Interrupt the urge to fix, flee, or justify**  
   *Recognize the impulse but let it pass.*

3. **Wait with it**  
   *Stay present, grounded, and open—even if it’s uncomfortable, foggy, or shame-laced.*

4. **Ask gently** (internally or aloud):  
   > *“What would skill look like here, if I could wait for it?”*

5. **Close with care**  
   - Do nothing, if that’s the wisest move.  
   - Or respond with a minimal, honest, non-reactive gesture.

## When to Use

- You’ve just acted/reacted in a way that feels off.
- Someone else is behaving unskillfully, and you're tempted to escalate.
- You feel the pull to retreat, attack, or explain, but know it won’t help.
- You're caught in a feedback loop and don’t yet know how to exit skillfully.

---

## When to Stop

- You feel **a shift**—in clarity, tone, or emotional energy.
- The compulsion to *do something* has softened.
- You've regained inner spaciousness or perspective.
- You recognize the risk of prolonged stagnation or passivity.

## Cautions

| Pattern | Risk |
|--------|------|
| **Passive Withdrawal** | Avoiding confrontation under guise of patience |
| **Moral Superiority** | Using “waiting” as a way to feel above others |
| **Endless Delay** | Using patience to evade responsibility |
| **Silent Contempt** | Masking judgment as non-reactivity |
| **Over-Containment** | Smothering emotional signals instead of metabolizing them |

---

## Suggested Frames

- “I can’t act skillfully yet, but I can *not* act unskillfully.”
- “I don’t know what to do, and that’s okay for now.”
- “Something in me wants to lash out. I will wait and see if anything wiser arrives.”

---

## Integration Practices

- **Journaling prompt**: *What did I wait with today that I didn’t react to?*
- **Embodied cue**: Notice tension in hands/jaw—release without speech.
- **Dialogic application**: After conflict, say:  
  > *“I wasn’t sure how to respond without escalating, so I waited. Here’s what came up.”*
