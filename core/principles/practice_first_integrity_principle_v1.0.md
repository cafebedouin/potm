## Practice-First Integrity Principle

Only include thinkers, influences, or frameworks in the lineage of *Pilates of the Mind* if doing so directly clarifies the nature and purpose of a specific **practice**.

### Operational Criteria

- If inclusion improves *practical understanding*, include it.
- If it introduces **metaphysical confusion**, **celebrity distraction**, or **dogmatic framing**, exclude it or relegate to a footnote.
- Prioritize **clarity of practice** and **phenomenological integrity** over:
  - Fame
  - Intellectual lineage
  - Philosophical completeness

### Example Application

> Jean Gebser is not a foundational figure in this framework. His work may be referenced in footnotes where it supports perceptual mutation or structural integration, but never prescriptively.

This principle enforces pragmatic clarity. *Pilates of the Mind* is not a philosophical anthology; it is a testable, adaptive framework for embodied inquiry.
