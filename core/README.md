\# üß± CORE COMPONENTS



This directory contains all \*\*canonical\*\*, stable components of the \*Pilates of the Mind\* (PoTM) framework.



These modules, principles, and protocols have undergone sufficient testing and refinement to be treated as \*\*default reference implementations\*\*. They represent the current best articulation of the system and are used in onboarding, AI prompting, and public documentation.

\## üîê Inclusion Criteria



A component is promoted to `core/` if it:



\- Demonstrates epistemic and practical clarity.

\- Has clear value in generative practice or integrity.

\- Has been tested by at least one human-AI collaboration with positive results.

\- Is free from major unresolved contradictions or drift.
