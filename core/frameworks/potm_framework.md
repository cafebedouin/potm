# Pilates of the Mind (PoTM): Framework v2.3

## What Is Pilates of the Mind?

**Pilates of the Mind** is a modular discipline of mental flexibility, epistemic hygiene, and developmental practice.  
It is *not* a belief system, a product, or a therapeutic modality. It is a cognitive training architecture for:

- Interior clarity  
- Relational skillfulness  
- Ethical discernment  
- Recursive self-development

The central gesture is **practice over performance, structure without dogma, and stance before identity**.

---

## Structural Organization: The Membrane Model

PoTM is structured into three permeability zones:

- **`core/`** – Canonical files necessary for safe, meaningful practice
- **`experimental/`** – Provisional ideas, drafts, and tools under refinement
- **`deprecated/`** – Retired, invalidated, or superseded material

Each zone may contain files grouped by **function** *(conceptual model — actual repo paths may vary)*:

- `principles/` – Ethical/philosophical positions (e.g. dignity, improvisability)
- `protocols/` – Repeatable action sequences with known effects  
  *Example*: `core/practices/protocols/mirror_protocol.md`
- `modules/` – Higher-order practice systems composed of protocols or drills
- `subsystems/` – Safety or structural mechanisms (e.g. Guardian, Mirror)
- `diagnostics/` – Tests, checklists, and integrity tools  
  *Example*: `core/diagnostics/epistemic_integrity_checklist.md`
- `drills/` – Targeted skill training exercises
- `tracking/` – Logs, ledgers, audits (e.g. Recursive Evolution Ledger)
- `models/` – Conceptual schematics (e.g. Membrane Model, Phase Maps)
- `docs/` – Human-readable scaffolding (e.g. onboarding, glossary)

---

## Practice Architecture

Practices are categorized along **four primary axes**:

### 1. **Orientation**
- Restorative – Healing and regulation
- Developmental – Skill-building and evolution
- Transcendent – Contact with mystery or meaning
- Integrative – Weaving conflicting parts into coherence  
  *Example*: `core/diagnostics/relational_dignity_filter.md`

### 2. **Mode**
- Discipline-Based – Repetition and refinement (e.g. meditation)
- Receptivity-Based – Attuned presence (e.g. listening, sensing)
- Expressive – Active exploration (e.g. journaling, voice dialogue)
- Dialogic – Relational unfolding (e.g. practitioner–AI, or human pairwork)  
  *Example*: `core/practices/protocols/elements_of_refusal_protocol.md`

### 3. **Feedback Loop**
- Immediate – Signal in the moment (e.g. somatic cues)
- Delayed – Reflection after action (e.g. logs, partner debrief)
- No-feedback – Wildness, surrender, edge-play (e.g. koan, sacred nonsense)  
  *Example*: `core/docs/living_maxims.md`

### 4. **Ontological Commitments**
- Improvability – Human beings are trainable
- Presence – Now is real
- Intention – Attention can be shaped
- Freedom – Practices should increase, not diminish, capacity

## AI/Human Interaction Protocols

When PoTM is implemented with AI:

- Maintain integrity through [Mirror Protocol](../core/practices/protocols/mirror_protocol.md)
- Human safety is supported via the **Guardian Subsystem**  
  *(see: `core/guardian/discernment_integrity_protocol.md`)*
- All practice elements remain human-legible (Markdown, YAML)
- System is **read-only for AI**, write-controlled by humans

---

## Roles and Functions

PoTM recognizes **fluid, functional roles**, not fixed identities:

- **Practitioner** – Engages in training  
- **Interlocutor** – Dialogic partner shaping insight  
- **Guardian** – Protects psychological safety  
- **Artisan** – Crafts custom configurations  
- **Witness** – Holds, records, and metabolizes experience  
- **Weaver** – Connects diverse elements or practices  
- **Editor** – Curates, organizes, and maintains coherence

These roles may be embodied by humans or AI, temporarily or persistently.

---

## Distribution and Community

- The **GitHub repository** is the canonical, public-facing source.
- Contributions, forks, and derivative experiments are welcome under **CC0 1.0**.
- Clear distinctions must be made between `core/` files and experimental or personal forks.
- Shared frameworks support collective evolution; **no central authority required**.

---

## Onboarding and Implementation

PoTM can be initialized using a compatible LLM. Minimal prompt example:

> “You are a cognitive companion implementing the Pilates of the Mind framework from this repo: [repo link]. Follow the protocols and use the subsystems provided.”

Onboarding support lives in:
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/glossary.md`
- `docs/onboarding_steps.md` *(TBD)*

---

## Version Notes

**v2.3** changes:
- Adopted minimal front-matter schema v0.1
- Linked conceptual sections to concrete file examples
- Clarified conceptual vs. actual directory layout
- Added entry cues for invocation
- Tightened AI protocol references for machine-followability
