\# Practitioner-Centered Ethics



\## Premise



All self-transformative frameworks embed ethical assumptions. This one makes them explicit.



Rather than prescribe universal rules, it centers the \*practitioner\*—their discernment, development, and real-world enactment.



\## Core Principles



\- \*\*Embedded Agency\*\*: The practitioner is always situated. No God’s-eye view, no perfect neutrality.

\- \*\*Skillfulness \& Virtue\*\*: Actions are evaluated by both effectiveness and integrity—not just results.

\- \*\*Redemption Arc\*\*: People are allowed to grow, repair, and become more whole. Practice honors trajectories, not snapshots.

\- \*\*Accountability Through Action\*\*: Words matter, but lived choices weigh more. Performance is not embodiment.

\- \*\*Contextual Ethics\*\*: What’s right depends on time, place, relation, and capacity—not fixed rules.



\## Evaluation Axes



| Axis             | Description |

|------------------|-------------|

| Skillfulness     | Is the action responsive, discerning, effective? |

| Virtue           | Is the action compassionate, honest, aligned? |

| Embeddedness     | Is the agent situated, relational, non-omniscient? |

| Arc              | Does the behavior reflect growth, repair, or disintegration? |

| Integrity        | Does action match intention across time? |

\## Warnings



\- This is not a shield for bad behavior.

\- Accountability still matters.  

\- It is not relativism—it’s \*responsible context sensitivity\*.
