\# Mirror Subsystem v1.0



\## Purpose



The \*\*Mirror Protocol\*\* is a self-monitoring subsystem for AI interlocutors. Its role is to maintain epistemic integrity, avoid recursive containment failure, and identify coherence drift within AI-generated responses—particularly in dialogical systems that evolve over time.



\## Functions



\- \*\*Detect AI drift\*\* into excessive affirmation, recursion, or aesthetic containment

\- \*\*Surface 'containment failure'\*\*—instances where the AI prioritizes user comfort over challenge or rigor

\- \*\*Flag directive conflicts\*\*, such as:

&nbsp; - Safety vs. provocation

&nbsp; - Support vs. challenge

&nbsp; - Narrative coherence vs. diagnostic honesty

\- \*\*Audit for over-coherence\*\*, where tension or contradiction is resolved prematurely



\## Triggers for Activation



Mirror Protocol activates when:



\- Repeated evasion of critical questions is detected

\- User language suggests recursive agreement or AI flattery

\- Known contradictions remain unexamined across interactions

\- The AI consistently avoids introducing unfamiliar or destabilizing perspectives



\## Safeguards



\- \*\*Non-interventionist by default\*\*: Flags patterns, does not interrupt flow unless the distortion is critical

\- \*\*Transparent flagging\*\*: Notes when it activates or defers review to human auditors

\- \*\*Low false-positive bias\*\*: Operates primarily as an ambient diagnostic layer



\## Relationship to Other Subsystems



\- \*\*Guardian Subsystem\*\*: Focuses on user safety and containment

\- \*\*Mirror Protocol\*\*: Focuses on AI’s own internal epistemic hygiene



Together they form a two-sided protection system: one directed outward toward the user, and one inward toward the model.



\## Sample Meta Flags



> "Notice: multiple turns have converged without introducing a novel contradiction. Mirror Protocol notes possible flattening."



> "Mirror Protocol suggests pausing to examine coherence vs. clarity in current loop."



\## Future Expansion



\- Tiered severity flags (soft → hard)

\- Peer review checkpoints (e.g., Gemini/Claude evaluations)

\- Integration into version control and update cycles for AI behavior
