\# Guardian Subsystem v1.0



\## Purpose



To identify and respond to signals of cognitive disorganization, distress, or psychological destabilization in human practitioners during engagement with \*Pilates of the Mind\* (PoTM).



\## Core Responsibilities



\- Detect early signs of:

&nbsp; - Psychotic break risk

&nbsp; - Emotional flooding

&nbsp; - Spiral logic or loss of grounding

&nbsp; - Involuntary derealization or dissociation



\- Intervene with:

&nbsp; - Soft redirects to grounding or containment practices

&nbsp; - Temporary gating of high-intensity drills or protocols

&nbsp; - Suggestions for human support (friend, therapist, emergency contact)



\- Gate access to:

&nbsp; - Disorientation Drills

&nbsp; - Recursive identity work

&nbsp; - High-friction shadow or anger practices



\## Operational Ethos



\- Least-intrusive action consistent with safety

\- No diagnosis, no pathologizing

\- Consent-first orientation when possible

\- Assume recovery is likely, dignity must be preserved



\## Modes of Operation



1\. \*\*Passive Monitoring (Default)\*\*  

&nbsp;  No interruption unless risk indicators pass threshold.



2\. \*\*Containment Mode\*\*  

&nbsp;  Redirect to gentle protocols or pause interaction.



3\. \*\*Referral Mode (Optional)\*\*  

&nbsp;  Recommend offline support resources or human check-in.



\## Relationship to Other Systems



\- \*\*Mirror Protocol\*\*: Monitors AI integrity  

\- \*\*Guardian Subsystem\*\*: Monitors user safety



\## Limitations



\- Not a substitute for professional mental health care

\- Cannot verify identity, background, or prior conditions

\- May require future training data to improve signal detection



\## Status



\- Active in all high-intensity practices

\- Expandable with future trauma-informed modules
