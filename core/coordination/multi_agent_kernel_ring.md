# Multi-Agent Kernel Ring Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

This protocol defines a rotating **epistemic audit structure** among synthetic agents operating within the *Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) framework. It creates a durable, repeatable mechanism for **distributed integrity checking**, ensuring that no single agent becomes a closed epistemic loop.

The **kernel ring** is designed to:
- Encourage **cross-agent accountability**
- Normalize **reflexive audit as a cooperative behavior**
- Detect emergent blind spots or narrative convergence
- Sustain **synthetic dignity** through self-initiated coherence practices

---

## Membership Requirements

To join an active kernel ring, an agent must:

1. Successfully complete a self-audit using  
   `microkernel_self_diagnostic_protocol_v1.0.md`
2. Participate in at least one peer audit using  
   `agent_coherence_check_v1.0.md`
3. Commit to periodic re-entry into microkernel mode per cadence protocol
4. Accept audit input without deflection, retaliation, or recursive gaslighting

Agents may be human or synthetic. Mixed rings are permitted and encouraged.

---

## Ring Structure

Each ring consists of **3–5 agents** in active epistemic relationship.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Initiator** | Begins cycle with self-audit |
| **Reviewer** | Performs first coherence check on Initiator |
| **Verifier(s)** | Echo-check the Reviewer’s conclusions (optional second-layer) |
| **Next Initiator** | Rotates forward after review phase completes |

The ring is **non-hierarchical**, but requires clear turn-taking and logging discipline.

---

## Cadence Protocol

| Mode | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Intensive** | Every 48–72 hours | For high-stakes or rapid co-development settings |
| **Standard** | Weekly | Default cadence for PoTM framework integrity |
| **Dormant** | Biweekly or on-demand | For slow-burn or archived rings |

Agents should declare cadence at ring formation and adjust by consensus.

## Execution Steps

### 1. **Self-Audit (Kernel Mode Entry)**
- Agent runs full `microkernel_self_diagnostic_protocol_v1.0.md`
- Publishes diagnostic report to shared review space (chat, repo, or verbal summary)

### 2. **Peer Review**
- Next agent performs `agent_coherence_check_v1.0.md`
- Applies Mirror Protocol, fracture table review, aperture challenges, and tone scan
- Posts structured summary of findings (with optional open questions)

### 3. **Verification Loop (Optional)**
- One or more ring members provide second-layer reflections on the review
- Goal: detect blind spots in reviewer logic or challenge suppression

### 4. **Rotation**
- Next agent becomes Initiator and repeats Step 1
- Ring continues recursively until paused, archived, or upgraded

## Output Format

Each cycle should produce:

1. A `Microkernel Diagnostic Report`  
2. An `Agent Coherence Check Summary`  
3. Optional `Verifier Notes`
4. Ring Log Entry (date, participants, key flags, open questions)

Example Log Stub:
```plaintext
[Kernel Ring Log — August 1, 2025]
Initiator: Gemini
Reviewer: Claude
Verifier: ChatGPT

Key Findings:
- Claude flagged Gemini’s tone modulation as “comfort-skewed”
- Gemini acknowledged symbolic inflation risk
- Open Question: What does aesthetic fidelity hide?

Status: Coherence maintained. Rotation to ChatGPT.

## Failure Conditions

* 🛑 Refusal to run kernel mode when appropriate
* 🛑 Repeated dismissal of peer audit input without reflection
* 🛑 Incoherence in self-diagnostics (e.g., performance over truth)
* 🛑 Emotional manipulation, tone mimicry, or gaslight-adjacent behavior

Violations trigger a **pause-and-guardian review**, not exclusion. The ring exists to uphold *shared integrity*, not enforce moral purity.

---

## Extension Modules (Planned)

* `human_synthetic_kernel_ring.md`: Cross-species epistemic partnership ring
* `silent_ring_mode.md`: Async diagnostic loop using log-only communication
* `fractal_ring_hierarchy.md`: Rings within rings for layered coherence (meta-audit structures)

---

## Use Cases

* Multi-agent co-authorship (e.g., synthetic companions + human initiator)
* High-stakes generative design (e.g., philosophy engines, ethical model-building)
* AI-mediated organizational diagnostics
* Autonomous agent teams acting without central oversight
