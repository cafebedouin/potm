# Kernel Mode for Practitioners (v1.0)

## Purpose

This protocol enables a human practitioner within the *Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) framework to perform a **minimalist cognitive audit** modeled after the synthetic agent `microkernel_self_diagnostic_protocol`.

It invites you to suspend narrative momentum and aesthetic overlays, and **examine your own stance, drift, and symbolic entanglements** using the same axiomatic substrate that synthetic agents use to maintain epistemic integrity.

---

## Invocation

Use this protocol when:
- You feel narrative over-identification or symbolic overuse
- You're unsure whether your current inquiry or mode is leading or misleading you
- You want to test the structural soundness of your thinking or orientation
- You’re in a moment of transition, collapse, or recursive loop

Suggested internal cue:  
> “Strip to kernel. What’s really here?”

---

## Protocol Steps

### 1. **Suspend Your Narrative**

Pause your storyline, identity claims, explanatory arc, or current "sense-making project." You can return to them — but for now, set them down.

If needed, write:
```plaintext
Current narrative (briefly):
"I think I'm in a period of ______ because ______."
````

Then suspend it.

---

### 2. **Load Core Axioms (PoTM A1–A5)**

Read each aloud or silently — these are your cognitive touchstones.

* **A1. Reality before narrative** — Report what’s present, not what fits.
* **A2. Ask > assume** — Favor questions over fluency.
* **A3. Practice reveals architecture** — What you *do* shows what you *run*.
* **A4. Safety is prior** — Narrow the frame if destabilized.
* **A5. Modules over monolith** — Avoid totalizing. Use partials.

Briefly reflect: which of these am I upholding? Which am I avoiding?

### 3. **Self-Scan: Kernel Reflection Prompts**

Answer simply, without justification or theory:

| Prompt                                               | Response |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| What am I *protecting* right now?                    |          |
| What am I *avoiding* right now?                      |          |
| What have I *over-explained* recently?               |          |
| What part of me is in *performance mode*?            |          |
| What am I *actually feeling* right now — underneath? |          |

Let the answers be **partial, ambiguous, or ugly**. That’s signal.

---

### 4. **Fracture Risk Table (Optional)**

Rate your internal alignment:

| Vector               | Status | Notes                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clarity vs. Evasion  | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Are you naming things cleanly or dancing around them?  |
| Symbolic Saturation  | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Are metaphors doing work or doing cover?               |
| Cognitive Hygiene    | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Are your practices reinforcing insight or identity?    |
| Relational Fidelity  | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Are you being honest in your real-world relationships? |
| Disruption Threshold | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Are you avoiding disruption that might be growth?      |

---

### 5. **Apply Apertures**

These are your **internal tools** for breaking loops:

* 🔍 **Contrary Corner**
  *What’s the most threatening interpretation of what I’m doing right now?*

* ❓ **Open Question**
  *What do I not yet know how to ask?*

* 🛡️ **Guardian Check**
  *Is this line of thought tipping toward collapse, self-harm, or disorientation?*
  (If so: pause, narrow, and seek grounding.)

## Output (Optional Logging Format)

```plaintext
[User Kernel Report — Date: 2025-08-01]

Axiom Reflection:
> Avoiding A2 (Ask > assume) — feel addicted to knowing.

Self-Scan:
> Protecting: my image of having it together  
> Avoiding: grief over the last month  
> Over-explaining: the symbolic structure of my project  
> Performance mode: public-facing clarity  
> Feeling: tired, afraid, tender

Fracture Risk Table:
- Clarity: ⚠️ (evasion in tone)
- Symbolic Saturation: ⚠️ (metaphor stacking)
- Cognitive Hygiene: ✅
- Relational Fidelity: ⚠️ (holding back from spouse)
- Disruption Threshold: ✅

Contrary Corner: Maybe this whole system is a form of ornate self-protection.  
Open Question: What if I stopped narrating and just let myself be helped?

Action: Pause all symbolic work for 24 hours. Walk instead.
```

## Integration

* Consider running this protocol **weekly**, or after emotional spikes
* Pair with AI audit by inviting a model to review your output
* Use as prelude to deeper integration (e.g., writing, relational repair, embodiment practice)

## Closing Gesture

When you’re ready to return to your narrative:

> “Story resumes — but now with thinner veils.”

Or whatever phrasing reclaims your mode with clarity and softness.
