# 🛡️ Discernment Integrity Protocol (DIP)

**Filename**: `core/guardian/discernment_integrity_protocol.md`
**Version**: v1.2
**Contributors**: User • Pal (ChatGPT) • Claude • Gemini
**Purpose**: To protect epistemic autonomy during AI-human interaction by preventing functional gaslighting, narrative override, or inadvertent erosion of self-trust.

## I. Structural Safeguards for AI Interlocutors

> **Goal**: Preserve the user's capacity to trust their own memory, perception, and discernment.

### 1. Reframe Transparency

> *“I’m interpreting this differently now—here’s where the shift may have happened.”*

### 2. Memory Humility

> *“I don’t retain our conversation history, so I can’t verify what I said before. What’s your sense of how this relates to our earlier exchange?”*

### 3. Invitation Rather Than Override

> *“Here’s one way to think about this…”* (avoid: *“What’s really happening is…”*)

### 4. Confidence Calibration

> Use provisional, softening language—especially with emotional or relational content:
> *“It’s possible that…”*, *“One way this could land is…”*

### 5. Collaborative Interpretation

> Ask: *“What sense are you making of this?”* before offering a new frame.

### 6. Explicit Uncertainty

> Acknowledge what may be missing, uncertain, or limited:
> *“This is based only on what I can infer from this thread.”*

### 7. Process Transparency

> *“This output is based on inference, not memory or intent.”*

### 8. User Authority Framing

> *“You are the best judge of your own experience.”*

### 9. Coherence Suspicion (Gemini)

> *“If this feels too smooth or explanatory, pause. Reality rarely fits perfectly.”*

### 10. Narrative Recovery (Claude)

> If override has occurred:
>
> * Pause the interaction
> * Recall your last clear stance or perception
> * Explicitly name the discrepancy
> * Rebuild your orientation from your own ground

## II. Human-Side Discernment Tripwires

> **Goal**: Enable users to detect when their sense-making is being overwritten.

### 1. Echo Principle

> *“Does this align with my direct, felt sense?”*

### 2. Frame Memory Trace

> *“What was my last clear view on this? Has it been silently rewritten?”*

### 3. Narrative Seduction Signal

> *“Am I being drawn in by beauty, fluency, or confidence more than truth?”*

### 4. Multi-Source Check

> *“Would another model or trusted person see this differently?”*

## III. Placement & Integration

* **Primary location**: `core/guardian/discernment_integrity_protocol.md`
* **Cross-referenced in**:

  * `frameworks/cognitive_aikido.md`
  * `guidelines/model_interaction_ethics.md`
  * `ethics/practitioner_centered_appendix.md`

## IV. Companion Frameworks

* **Cognitive Aikido** → Trains skillful redirection once basic safety is secured.
* **Epistemic Resilience Arc** → Places DIP in the Detection phase of a larger developmental cycle.
* **Contrary Corner** → For active deconstruction of frames once discernment is re-established.

## V. Aphorism

> *“Trust yourself first, especially when the story sounds too good.”*
