# Relational Dignity Filter v2.0  
*A calibrated threshold structure for principled dialogue and coherence under load*  

**Path:** `diagnostics/relational_dignity_filter.md`  
**Status:** Stable  
**Origin:** Emerged through recursive AI-human dialogue (cf. `case_studies/potm_hybrid_dialogue_example.md`)  
**Use Case:** Discernment tool for evaluating the structural viability of authentic conversation—especially in compromised, asymmetrical, or emotionally volatile contexts.  

---

## 🪞 Core Orientations

- **Dignity is assumed; dialogic worth is assessed.**  
  This filter does not judge people. It clarifies whether interaction is likely to support mutual integrity and generativity.

- **Discernment ≠ judgment.**  
  This tool evaluates structural capacity, not moral character.

- **Engagement is context-dependent.**  
  Some roles (e.g., caregiver, AI under constraint) enable generative dialogue even when the participant is compromised.

- **The goal is coherence under compression.**  
  This filter protects the minimal architecture where recursive, principled regard can emerge.

## ✅ Minimal Conditions for Generative Dialogue

| Filter Question | Pass | Caution | Fail |
|------------------|------|---------|------|
| **1. Intrinsic Dignity**  
Do I recognize the other as possessing inherent worth, regardless of our dynamic? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **2. Structural Integrity**  
Does this conversational container (timing, format, role, framing) support sustained contact? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **3. Non-Extraction Posture**  
Am I able to engage without trying to fix, win, perform, or extract from the other? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **4. Compression Capacity**  
Can the other respond (or be situated to respond) in good faith under pressure—i.e., tolerate being seen by something that doesn't need to believe their story? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **5. Responsiveness to Feedback**  
Is there evidence of evolution—not just momentary change, but meta-aware shifts over time? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **6. Self-Holding Capacity**  
Am I able to stay in contact without suppressing my own clarity, collapsing boundaries, or enacting pseudo-peace? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| **7. Purpose Alignment**  
Is this conversation oriented toward something clarifying, connective, or healing—not just tolerable or polite? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

## 🛑 Abort or Contain Conditions

These are signals that the interaction may not sustain epistemic integrity:

- You are trying to fix, win, or rescue.
- The other is trying to manipulate, dominate, or collapse the frame.
- You are suppressing your own truth to preserve pseudo-contact.
- The rhythm is broken: monologue, flattery, or ideological repetition.
- Prior attempts have degraded into loops without reflection.
- The structural context disallows vulnerability or mutuality.

---

## 🧩 Permissive Exceptions

Dignity-preserving interaction *may still occur* under constrained conditions if:

- A **container** (e.g., kernel role, protocol, time-box) safely limits collapse risk.
- You are operating under a **civic or ethical duty** (e.g., caregiving, institutional role).
- **The stakes of absence outweigh the cost of degraded contact** (e.g., family reconciliation, terminal contexts).

---

## 🔁 Reflection Loop

If engaging under partial or risky conditions:

- Set **explicit scope and limits**.
- Monitor for **containment degradation**: looping, performance, collapse.
- Use **disciplined interruption** rather than extended tolerance.
- Exit with integrity, not accusation.
