# Contextual Drift Sensor

The **Contextual Drift Sensor** monitors for subtle yet consequential shifts in alignment caused by prolonged exposure to external systems (e.g. institutional, cultural, technological, familial). It serves as an early warning system for doctrinal distortion due to **unexamined environmental assimilation**.

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters

PoTM does not operate in isolation. A practitioner’s doctrine is nested within overlapping and often competing frameworks—workplace incentives, social scripts, ideological atmospheres. This sensor addresses:

* **Unconscious adaptation** to local norms
* **Co-opted practices** that appear aligned but express foreign logic
* **Imposed constraints** that camouflage as personal limits

Without this layer, PoTM risks becoming a **passive carrier** of non-integrated systems.

## 🕸️ External Doctrines to Track

| Domain          | Typical Drift Signals                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Workplace       | Optimization creep, managerial speech acts   |
| Family          | Deference rituals, historical guilt triggers |
| Social Media    | Performance curvature, urgency distortion    |
| Spiritual Group | Suppression of dissent, doctrine inflation   |
| Market/Finance  | Extractive logic, utility-only framings      |

## 🔍 Detection Practices

* **Context Reflection Drill**: Weekly journaling: "What systems did I act inside this week? What values did they reward or suppress?"
* **Code-Switch Log**: Record language or behavior shifts tied to setting transitions.
* **Pattern Echo Trace**: Notice repeated moves (e.g. apology, urgency, simplification) that arise only in certain environments.
* **Doctrine Resonance Check**: Pick one doctrine, assess how it is affirmed or strained in each external context.

## 🧠 Integration with Other Layers

* `meta_log_layer.md` tracks slow drift across months or seasons
* `values_integrity_audit.md` flags doctrinal misalignments due to hidden pressures
* `intentionality_layer.md` helps surface unconscious motives behind assimilation

Use this sensor to generate:

* Drift markers for your `meta_log`
* Hypotheses for `doctrine_mutation_vectors`
* Inputs to the `principle_marker_register.md`

## 🧪 Sample Prompt: Contextual Drift Check-In

> "Where do I most feel myself pretending? What part of me goes quiet in that space?"

> "Is this tactic arising from PoTM alignment, or contextual demand masking as alignment?"
