# 🧽 Skillfulness Diagnostic v1.0

## Purpose

This diagnostic helps practitioners explore:

> _Did my action align with the moment, the relationship, and the version of myself I’m practicing into?_

Skillfulness is **not correctness**.  
It’s not about winning, being kind, or being right.  
It’s about **fit, timing, tone, impact, and discernment**—as lived in context.

Use this not to grade yourself, but to metabolize what just happened.

---

## When to Use This

- After a **Signal Bleed rep** that felt confusing, off, or ambiguous
- When a **Bridge Gesture** was rejected, misread, or landed differently than expected
- Following a **relational or ethical fracture**
- Anytime you feel: _“That didn’t quite work, and I want to understand why.”_

## Six Diagnostic Dimensions

Use these as perceptual lenses. Not all will be relevant every time.

|Dimension|Framing Question|
|---|---|
|**Timing**|Did I act too soon, too late, or right on time?|
|**Tone**|Did the way I say or do this resonate or cause friction?|
|**Intent**|Was I acting from clarity or reaction?|
|**Impact**|How did it land—for me, for others, for the space?|
|**Relational Fit**|Did I respect where the other(s) were emotionally, cognitively?|
|**Self-Fit**|Did this reflect the kind of practitioner I intend to become?|

## Diagnostic Prompts

Choose 2–4 after a meaningful or uncertain interaction.

- What was my felt sense _before_ acting?
- Did I override any internal hesitation or signal?
- Did my tone match the environment and relational context?
- Was my gesture clean, or mixed with subtext?
- What ripple did this action create (seen or imagined)?
- What would I change if this same moment returned?

---

## Optional Reflection Format

```
◼ Event Description:
(What happened? 1–3 sentences max)

◼ Observed Effects:
- On myself:
- On others:
- On the shared space:

◼ Skillfulness Notes:
- What worked?
- What missed the mark?
- Was there a fracture?

◼ Practitioner Reflection:
- What is this teaching me?
- What might I try differently next time?
```

## Cautions

- 🚫 This is not a test.
- 🚫 This is not for moral scorekeeping.
- 🚫 This is not a tool for evaluating others.

👌 This is for **metabolizing lived experience** through the lens of growth.
