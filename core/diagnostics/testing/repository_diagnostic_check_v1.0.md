# Repository Diagnostic Check: Epistemic Grounding

This check ensures that the *Pilates of the Mind* repository reflects and supports strong epistemic practices across its framework, modules, and documentation.

## Purpose

To assess whether PoTM materials model the kinds of epistemic responsibility, transparency, and self-skepticism the framework asks of practitioners.

---

## Diagnostic Prompts

### 1. **Clarity of Claims**

* Do all core documents avoid vague metaphysical or mystical assertions?
* Are operational terms (e.g., "insight," "practice," "integrity") defined or contextualized?

### 2. **Transparency of Sources**

* Are influences or external frameworks credited without over-claiming affiliation?
* Are any thinker references (e.g., Gebser, Bateson) footnoted or bracketed with caveats where interpretive ambiguity might confuse?

### 3. **Accountability Markers**

* Are file authorship and version history clearly stated in YAML headers?
* Is it obvious what material is canonical vs. experimental vs. deprecated?

### 4. **Internal Coherence**

* Are key principles (e.g., human dignity, practitioner-centered ethics) consistently reflected in protocols and subsystems?
* Are any documents inadvertently contradicting each other without commentary?

### 5. **Use of Speculation**

* Are speculative modules and experimental ideas clearly marked as such?
* Are invitations to test or explore present instead of authoritative claims?

## Output Format (Optional)

A diagnostic pass may include a brief YAML diagnostic report:

```yaml
diagnostic_name: "epistemic_grounding"
status: "pass_with_caveats"
reviewer: "cafebedouin"
date: "2025-07-24"
notes:
  - "The core principles and protocols reflect epistemic clarity."
  - "One experimental subsystem uses language (e.g., 'mirror self') that might confuse some users without further framing."
```

## Notes for Reviewers

* This diagnostic is best used during major updates or public releases.
* Consider using it in tandem with the `epistemic_integrity_checklist_v1.0.md` protocol to identify internal blind spots.
* Contributions that fail this diagnostic should not be removedâ€”just properly bracketed as exploratory or under development.
