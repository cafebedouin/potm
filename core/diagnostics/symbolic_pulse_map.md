# Symbolic Pulse Map

The **Symbolic Pulse Map** is a diagnostic overlay for tracking symbolic coherence across the *Pilates of the Mind* cascade. It helps detect misalignment not through logic or metrics, but through **poetic dissonance**, **metaphor drift**, and **naming tension**.

This layer complements affective and tactical signals by revealing how *language itself begins to strain* under drift conditions.

## üß≠ Purpose

* Detect symbolic signs of **integrity loss** or **principle drift**.
* Reveal where metaphors or naming conventions no longer ring true.
* Track where aesthetic or poetic consistency masks unresolved fractures.

---

## üîç Signal Types

### 1. **Glyphic Resonance Zones**

* Map where glyphs show consistent usage across domains
* Detect overuse (aesthetic camouflage) or sudden disappearance (semantic collapse)
* Examples:

  * `‚áÑ` overused in places where no genuine reciprocity is present
  * `‚ú∂` disappears when mystery is bypassed in doctrine

### 2. **Metaphor Drift**

* Original metaphors become strained or stretched (e.g., soil/gut/sensor loop fraying)
* Layer mismatches: metaphors from one level (tactics) intrude into another (principle) incoherently
* Symptom of either creative expansion *or* semiotic confusion

### 3. **Tone-Texture Mismatch**

* Naming conventions take on a tone that doesn‚Äôt match the principle they express
* Examples:

  * Tactical file has clinical detachment for a practice rooted in compassion
  * Doctrinal statement framed with too much flourish, masking imprecision

### 4. **Poetic Saturation**

* Excess symbolic flourish in the presence of conceptual strain
* May be sign of avoidance or over-performance
* Marked by clusters of metaphor with no operational anchor

---

## üß™ Suggested Practice: Resonance Check

* Read key doctrinal or strategic statements aloud
* Ask: *Do the words still feel like they belong to the principles beneath them?*
* Listen for subtle shifts in rhythm, tone, or language weight
* Invite glyphs, if used, to be redrawn or renamed if they no longer spark alignment

---

## üìç Integration Points

* `principle_marker_register.md`: cross-reference symbolic pulse anomalies with principle tension markers
* `meta_log_layer.md`: note symbolic dissonance as slow drift signal
* `values_integrity_audit.md`: use pulse map to surface non-logical precursors to breach

---

## üåê Future Considerations

* Visual plotting of glyph resonance zones across cascade
* AI-assisted metaphor evolution tracking
* Pulse tension heatmaps across domains or over time

Symbolic health is often the first to falter and last to be challenged. The **Symbolic Pulse Map** gives subtle language the diagnostic dignity it deserves.
