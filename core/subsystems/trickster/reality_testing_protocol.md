🌐 Reality Testing Protocol v1.1

🗭 Purpose

The Reality Testing Protocol exists to discern the edge between transformation and disorientation. It provides a structured pause to determine whether current experience is leading toward insight or veering into dissociative loop, avoidance, or frame collapse.

It supports practitioners in remaining embedded, embodied, and oriented, especially during or after Trickster-mode engagements.

🛠 Protocol Sequence

🔹 1. Somatic Baseline Check

> "Can I feel my breath in my body?" "Can I locate my feet, hands, or spine?" "Am I oriented in time and place?" "Do I know what day it is and what I’m responsible for today?"



If no to more than one, pause. Name your location aloud. Reconnect physically before continuing cognitive work.


---

🔹 2. Cognitive Signal Scan

> "Do my thoughts make contact with lived concerns?" "Am I looping in abstraction or irony without direction?" "Have I begun to treat everything as a symbol?" "Would this experience be considered ‘contact’ or ‘concern’ in other traditions or communities I trust?"



Rate coherence on a 1–5 scale:
1 = dreamlike disconnection
5 = pragmatic insight with grounding


---

🔹 3. Emotional Integrity Prompt

> "Is this discomfort surfacing something true, or am I numbing against contact?" "What emotion is beneath the laughter or cleverness?" "Can I still connect authentically with others?"



If answer is unclear, pause to name three emotions currently present. Let that data inform your direction.


---

🔹 4. Commitment Cross-Check (Optional)

> "Do my recent commitments still feel real?" "Do they still call to me, even in this state?"



If yes: consider returning through Commitment Subsystem. If no: honor the suspension, and revisit after rest or integration.


---

🔹 5. Return or Redirect Decision

Based on the above:

If somatic signal is strong, coherence is 3+, and emotional contact is available: proceed.

If somatic signal is weak or emotional data is suppressed: pause or switch modes (e.g., Guardian, Commitment).

If in deep liminality, consider invoking Integration Bridge Protocol even if insight is incomplete.

📊 Optional Output Log

You may log:

Coherence rating (1–5)

Emotional state summary

Next action (continue / pause / redirect / initiate bridge)


This log can be tracked longitudinally to identify personal thresholds and patterns.

🚫 Misuse Warnings

Not all weirdness is danger. Trickster often feels disorienting. That does not mean it is harmful.

Don’t use this protocol to bypass discomfort. Growth often begins where comfort ends.

Don’t mistake clever loops for clarity. If everything feels equally funny or meaningless, it's time to test.



---

🌿 Closing Phrase

> "This is not a test of safety. It is a test of aliveness."



Return gently. Choose your direction from contact, not from fear.
