🌺 Sacred/Profane Boundary Protocol v1.1

🗭 Purpose

This protocol helps practitioners discern when the Trickster must bow. Not all moments welcome the sacred clown. Some call for containment, reverence, or holy silence.

It offers a discernment layer: not to block irreverence, but to ask “Is this gesture skillful, respectful, timely?”

Used during one-on-one dialogue, group space holding, ritual design, or inner ethical navigation.

🛠 Protocol Steps

🔹 1. Context Scan

> "Am I entering a field marked by grief, death, trauma, or prayer?" "Is the other person (or part of me) in a vulnerable, liminal, or initiatory state?" "Is this field trauma-tinged or potentially retraumatizing?"



If yes: proceed with caution. Trickster may still enter—but must be cloaked, slow, and listening.


---

🔹 2. Intent Clarification

> "What am I trying to do by introducing irreverence, paradox, or inversion here?" "Is it to liberate? Deflect? Perform? Distract? Humble? Heal?" "What is my role or position here, and how might that shape how this lands?"



If not in service of connection, healing, or clarity—pause.


---

🔹 3. Cultural Sensitivity Prompt

> "Would this gesture land differently across cultural or ancestral lines I’m not fluent in?" "When unsure, can I bow or ask before proceeding?"



Add humility. Leave room for cultural boundaries that may be invisible to you.


---

🔹 4. Reframe Invitation

> "Is there a more honest form this intervention could take?" "Can I ask a question rather than make a joke?" "Can the silence do the work instead?"



If the answer is yes: shift tone or stance. Choose reverence over cleverness.


---

🔹 5. Symbolic Bow (Optional)

If Trickster must enter sacred space, begin with an acknowledgment:

A phrase: "I enter laughing, but I see the fire."

A gesture: hand to heart, gaze lowered

A disclaimer: "This may land wrong—and I’m open to correction."


Signals humility. Invites relational correction.


---

🔹 6. Repair Protocol (Optional)

If misjudgment has occurred:

Name the misstep: "That may have missed the moment."

Apologize without performance: "I regret the timing."

Ask how to reconnect: "How can I rejoin you in this space more skillfully?"


Do not self-flagellate. Stay present. Return gently.


---

🌈 Boundary Signals for Others

Use when facilitating or holding space:

"We’re entering sacred ground now."

"Jokes can wait until we re-emerge."

Light a candle, ring a bell, remove shoes

Name a pause: "Let’s give this moment its due."


These protect the field without moralizing.


---

🚫 Misuse Warnings

Don’t use reverence to shut down truth-telling

Don’t weaponize "sacredness" to avoid discomfort

Don’t shame Trickster when it shows up awkwardly—redirect with care



---

🙏 Closing Gesture

> "There are things not to be mocked—and even those things, we must approach with gentle laughter, or not at all."



Let the silence or gesture speak. Let Trickster bow. Let the sacred remain unbroken when it must.
