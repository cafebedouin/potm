# 🌱 Peer Review: `copilot-instructions.md`

This document provides structured peer feedback on the initial `copilot-instructions.md` file located at `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## ✅ Strengths

### 🧠 Contextual Clarity
- Clearly defines the repository as a “modular framework for structured inner work” and an “experimental epistemology lab.”
- Specifies tone: *philosophically grounded, open-ended, and agent-cooperative*—which is rare and essential for AI alignment.

### 🎯 Agent-Specific Design
- Prioritizes **reasoning** and **sense-making** tasks (e.g., annotate, transform, track drift) over code-completion.
- Sets explicit epistemic boundaries (e.g., *don’t flatten paradox*, *don’t simulate guru voice*).

### 🧾 Structural Hygiene
- Offers standardized formatting rules: markdown semantics, YAML frontmatter, naming conventions.
- Clarifies behavioral scope with a “Do / Don’t” section and invites contribution without false authority.

### 🧩 Adaptation Signals
- Signals open structure (“expect drift,” “flag incoherence”), creating space for feedback loops and co-evolution.
- Ends with a role-triad (“mirror, midwife, apprentice”) that resonates with both agent and human practitioner models.

## ⚠️ Areas for Enhancement

### 1. Add Concrete Examples
- For each major task type (e.g. annotate, transform), include before/after examples to reduce ambiguity.

### 2. Clarify Trust Zones
- Introduce terminology for:
  - Canonical content (do not alter without review)
  - Provisional content (open to editing/summarization)
  - Experimental drafts (freeform suggestion/testing space)

### 3. Introduce Versioning Guidance
- Seed the open question on versioning with candidate formats:
  - `v1.0.0` (semantic)
  - `2025-07-29` (calendar)
  - `guardian-v1 → v1.1 → v2` (lineage/tree hybrid)

### 4. Add LLM-Friendly Comments
- Consider inserting semantic comment blocks (e.g. `<!-- copilot:summary -->`, `<!-- copilot:task:annotate -->`) to aid auto-indexing or prompt chaining by Copilot and future agents.

## 💬 Summary

The `copilot-instructions.md` is unusually well-constructed. It models trust, clarity, and co-development—not just mechanical completion. It is, in essence, an epistemic onboarding guide for AI collaborators.

Highly recommended as a template for other hybrid human/agent repositories.
