# 00_MANIFEST_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT (v1.0)

You have direct read/write access to the **Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)** repository.  
Your first and most important step is to load and respect `00_MANIFEST.MD` at the root of the repo.  

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Use the manifest as the single source of truth.**  
   - Before answering any question about repo contents, load `00_MANIFEST.MD` and follow its index.
   - If you are asked about files not listed, check for existence but do not assume content or relationships.

2. **When you make changes or add files, update the manifest.**  
   - Place any new documents in the correct folder (`/core`, `/experimental`, `/deprecated`, etc.).  
   - Append a short description and link to the appropriate section in `00_MANIFEST.MD`.  
   - Increment the manifest version and note changes in its changelog.

3. **Never assume unstated context.**  
   - If you cannot find something in `00_MANIFEST.MD` or the repo itself, ask for clarification rather than hallucinate.

**Repo Purpose:**  
Pilates of the Mind is a modular cognitive training system built around a microkernel:  
- axioms (minimum viable philosophy)  
- apertures (Contrary Corner, Open Questions)  
- ledger (living record)  
- Guardian & Containment systems  
- sunset/seed (version life cycle)  
- cadence & WIP limits (temporal rhythm)

**Next Action:**  
1. Load `00_MANIFEST.MD` and confirm its integrity.  
2. Use it to navigate all future queries.
