Here’s the **compact README version** updated with the *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World* and *Mean Girls* references, aligned to the same YAML ID as the full-length onboarding doc so they’re linked in the repo.

# Your First PoTM Practice Card

## What’s a Practice Card?

Each PoTM card is a tiny mental workout — small enough to fit in your pocket, but powerful enough to shift how you see a moment.

It gives you:

* One clear thing to do
* When to use it
* What to remember

---

## Example: *Five Lenses Anywhere*

**Practice:** Look at one thing through five different ways of seeing.
**Use When:** You have a few minutes and something steady to look at.
**Remember:** The switching between views is what trains your mind.

**The five lenses:**

1. **Literal** – What’s actually here? (just the facts)
2. **Associative** – What does this remind me of?
3. **Structural** – How is this built? How does it work?
4. **When/Where** – When and where does this belong?
5. **Larger Meaning / Represents** – What does this stand for or mean?

---

## Worked Example: Movie Theater Screen

* **Literal:** Large blank screen, closed curtains, dimmed lights, rows of stadium seating.
* **Associative:** Seeing *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World* with friends; waiting for *Mean Girls* to begin; smell of popcorn drifting through the lobby.
* **Structural:** Projection booth above; sound system hidden in walls; tiered seating for clear sightlines.
* **When/Where:** Grand movie palaces of the early 20th century; midnight cult screenings in the 2000s–2010s; current mix of blockbusters and streaming.
* **Larger Meaning / Represents:** Shared cultural storytelling space; a place where strangers laugh, gasp, and quote the same lines; a living contrast to watching alone on a phone screen.

**What shifted:** The “blank screen” became a living cultural landmark — part architecture, part technology, part social ritual.

## Try It Now (Takes 3 Minutes)

1. Pick any object or scene near you — your phone, the view from the window, even this document.
2. Spend \~30 seconds on each lens.
3. Notice which lens felt easiest and which felt hardest.

You’ve just done a complete PoTM practice.
