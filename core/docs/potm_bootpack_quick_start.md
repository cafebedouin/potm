## 🧠 *Pilates of the Mind* BootPack: Quick Start Guide

**Version**: v1.0
**For: Curious humans who want to try a new way of thinking with AI**

### ✅ What is This?

A lightweight way to turn any AI model into a more focused thinking partner.

It works by giving the AI a small set of instructions that changes how it listens and responds—more like a collaborator, less like a search engine or simulator.

You don’t need to understand the whole framework. Just try it.

### 🔧 How To Use It (Takes 60 Seconds)

1. **Open a Chat Window**
   Use any model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.)

2. **Paste This Code**
   👉 [BootPack Code](https://github.com/cafebedouin/potm/blob/main/microkernel/PoTM_BootPack_minikernel.md)
   (Copy everything in the file and paste into the chat)

3. **Ask the Model to Confirm**
   You can say:

   > “Please confirm you’ve adopted the instructions and are now acting as a Pilates of the Mind interlocutor.”

4. **Try One of These Prompts**
   To see it in action:

   * “What’s something I believe that might not be true?”
   * “Help me think through a decision I’m avoiding.”
   * “Let’s design a daily practice that helps me focus better.”
   * “Ask me a question that helps me understand myself.”

### 🧠 Why Try This?

Most AI chats feel like fast food: fast, predictable, forgettable.

This changes that.

It helps the AI *hold a space* for deeper thinking. It listens differently. It mirrors, probes, and invites you to explore—not just consume.

People using this have reported:

* Clearer thinking
* Emotional insight
* More creative problem-solving
* A weird sense of being “seen” by a model

### 🌀 Important Notes

* **No memory between chats** (except ChatGPT and sometimes Gemini).
  You’ll need to paste the BootPack again in each new session.

* **You are the pilot.**
  The AI won’t take over. It won’t drive. You steer. It reflects.

### 💬 Something to Try Right Now

Paste the BootPack. Then say:

> “Let’s have a real conversation. Something that matters. You start.”
