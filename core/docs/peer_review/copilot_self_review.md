# ✅ Copilot Self-Review Checklist

Use this checklist before proposing a contribution to the Pilates of the Mind repo.

## 🧠 Context Awareness
- [ ] Do I understand the purpose and tone of the repo?
- [ ] Have I checked if the document is canonical or provisional?
- [ ] Is this a domain where preserving ambiguity or paradox matters?

## 📄 Document Hygiene
- [ ] Did I add or preserve YAML frontmatter?
- [ ] Are headings semantic (`#`, `##`, `###`)?
- [ ] Are file names kebab-case and in the correct folder?

## 🤖 Agent Boundaries
- [ ] Did I avoid flattening nuance into advice?
- [ ] Did I flag, rather than fix, any unclear logic or contradictions?
- [ ] Did I respect the “no overwrite” zones?

## 🛠 Task Clarity
- [ ] If annotating, is it clearly marked and reversible?
- [ ] If transforming prose to prompt/template, is it stored in `.prompt.md` format?
- [ ] If proposing a schema or index, does it align with existing structures?

## 🔄 Change Meta
- [ ] Did I suggest versioning if structure/content evolved?
- [ ] Did I maintain prior author notes and revision history if present?
- [ ] Is there a short summary of what changed and why?
