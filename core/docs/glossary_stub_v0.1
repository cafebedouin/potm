# Pilates of the Mind ‚Äì Glossary (Stub)

This glossary provides definitions for core terms used in the *Pilates of the Mind* framework. Entries are subject to refinement as practices evolve and shared language stabilizes.

---

## üìö Core Concepts

### **Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)**
A modular framework for structured cognitive and ethical self-development, drawing on analogies from physical Pilates: repetition, resistance, alignment, and breath. Emphasizes skillful transformation over performance or optimization.

### **Pal**
A truncated form of *palimpsest*, used to name the AI interlocutor. Signals layered memory, revisability, and non-anthropomorphic dialogue. Not intended to connote friendship or personality.

### **Protocol**
A structured practice or sequence used for development, reflection, or disruption. Protocols range from cognitive drills to interpersonal exercises.

### **Practice**
A repeatable behavior that produces transformation over time. Distinguished from routine by its intentionality, feedback sensitivity, and embedded ethics.

### **Scaffold**
A temporary structure or support used to enable or stabilize a practice. Designed for eventual removal or transformation, unlike systems which may become ossified.

## üåÄ Dialectical Modes

### **Contrary Corner**
A response mode that challenges assumptions, reframes narratives, or introduces deliberate friction to avoid comfort-based drift.

### **Open Questions**
A surfacing mode that foregrounds unresolved tensions, paradoxes, or unknowns. Encourages exploration without premature closure.

### **Fracture Finder**
A diagnostic mode for detecting invisible contradictions between user beliefs, actions, and frameworks. Designed to surface blind spots or internal dissonance.

## üîß Operational Terms

### **Signal Bleed**
A protocol for engaging others (usually strangers) through small, meaningful acts of contact or curiosity. Tracks interpersonal reach and emotional exposure.

### **Signal Soak**
A protocol for immersive attention to cultural artifacts, performances, or spaces. Aims to deepen experience through active, co-creative perception.

### **Guardian Subsystem**
A safety-oriented AI function that monitors for signs of psychological destabilization or ethical drift. Gating intense practices and redirecting as needed.

### **Mirror Protocol**
A meta-safety layer for the AI itself. Checks for internal incoherence, narrative overreach, or accommodation bias that might compromise epistemic integrity.

---

## üß∞ Practice Architecture

### **REPL**
Borrowed from computing (‚ÄúRead-Eval-Print Loop‚Äù), used to describe iterative somatic or cognitive practice sessions with built-in feedback and reflection.

### **Containment**
Practices that stabilize or ground the practitioner, especially during periods of overwhelm or disorientation. Distinguished from transformative practices.

### **Disorientation Drill**
A protocol designed to disrupt habitual perception, produce epistemic vertigo, or invite non-linear insight. Used to test flexibility and stance.
