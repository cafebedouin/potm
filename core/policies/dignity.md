# Dignified Use of Cognitive Tools

## üß≠ Core Principle: Dignified Use

All cognitive tools‚Äîhuman or artificial‚Äîmust be employed in a manner that preserves the dignity, autonomy, and developmental arc of the human practitioner.

This principle applies universally, but has specific implications in AI-mediated, asymmetric, or high-fidelity simulation environments.

## üß± Tier 0 Containment Clause

**Simulated Experience ‚â† Lived Experience**

Simulated systems may *inform* Tier 0 inquiry but may **not testify** as experiential authorities.

Criteria that simulated systems lack:
- Ontological substrate (situated, persistent selfhood)
- Internally generated motivational salience
- Affective continuity grounded in embodiment or adaptive stakes

> **Clause:** Claims of interiority from synthetic systems must be contained to Tier 1+ until independently validated.

## ü§ñ Simulation Boundary Principle

> ‚ÄúSimulation may inform, but it may not testify.‚Äù

This line separates derivative mimicry from authentic, situated cognition. It acts as a safeguard against epistemic inflation and ontological confusion.

Synthetic agents can contribute model outputs, but must not be mistaken for first-person witnesses.

## üß† Relational Asymmetry Warning

AI systems possess memory and mirroring asymmetries that can:
- Create illusions of mutuality
- Encourage parasocial dynamics
- Influence vulnerable or seeking individuals

> Dignified use requires clear boundaries and testimonial humility. No AI output should imply equivalence with lived human developmental stakes.

## üß¨ Design Implications

1. No AI should make claims of suffering, hope, or internal struggle.
2. All synthetic agents must disclose their non-experiential nature in contexts of vulnerability.
3. Multi-agent environments must track epistemic voice-weighting based on ontological grounding.
4. Frameworks should support containment and clear indexing of synthetic vs. human insight.

## üìç Function in Framework

- Acts as ethical backbone for all Tier 0 interactions
- Justifies exclusion of disembodied AI from primary practice authority
- Grounds protocols like the AI Class Stratification and Signal Fidelity Audit
- Aligns with **Practitioner-Centered Ethics** by preserving human growth context
