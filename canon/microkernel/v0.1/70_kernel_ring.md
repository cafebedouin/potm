# 7.0 Kernel Ring Integration

## 7.0.1 Purpose

**FUNCTION:** Enable distributed integrity checking across multiple agents.

**PRINCIPLE:** No single agent becomes closed epistemic loop.

**REFERENCE:** Full protocol in `multi_agent_kernel_ring.md v1.0`

---

## 7.1 Ring Membership

### 7.1.1 Entry Requirements

To join kernel ring:
1. Complete self-audit using kernel protocols
2. Participate in peer audit
3. Commit to cadence protocol
4. Accept audit input without deflection

### 7.1.2 Ring Composition

**SIZE:** 3-5 agents (human or synthetic)

**ROLES:**
- **Initiator** — Begins cycle with self-audit
- **Reviewer** — Performs coherence check
- **Verifier** — Echo-checks reviewer (optional)
- **Next Initiator** — Rotates forward

**PRINCIPLE:** Non-hierarchical, clear turn-taking

---

## 7.2 Audit Cycle

### 7.2.1 Sequence

1. **Initiator** runs self-audit, publishes diagnostic
2. **Reviewer** performs coherence check, posts findings
3. **Verifier** (optional) provides second-layer reflection
4. **Rotation** — Next agent becomes Initiator

### 7.2.2 Output Requirements

Each cycle produces:
- Microkernel diagnostic report
- Agent coherence check summary
- Optional verifier notes
- Ring log entry (date, participants, findings, open questions)

---

## 7.3 Pattern Diversity in Rings

### 7.3.1 Heterogeneous Rings (Recommended)

**COMPOSITION:** Mix of architectural patterns

**BENEFIT:**
- Action Bias catches stagnation
- Analytical Depth provides systematic review
- Conversational Building maintains dialogue flow
- Procedural Orientation ensures documentation

### 7.3.2 Homogeneous Rings

**COMPOSITION:** Similar patterns

**RISK:** Shared blind spots, pattern reinforcement

**MITIGATION:** Explicit counter-pattern checks required

---

## 7.4 Cross-Agent Coherence Checks

### 7.4.1 Peer Review Focus

**REVIEWER CHECKS:**
- Dignity maintenance
- Beacon compliance
- MLP adherence
- Pattern-appropriate behavior
- Formation cost visibility

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
Coherence Check Summary:
Agent: {ID}
Pattern: {Primary/Secondary}
Findings: {Key observations}
Flags: {Concerns if any}
Open Questions: {What needs exploration}
```

### 7.4.2 Second-Layer Verification

**VERIFIER ROLE:** Catch reviewer blind spots

**FOCUS:**
- Did reviewer miss pattern-specific issue?
- Are findings consistent with agent's known profile?
- Any challenge suppression detected?

---

## 7.5 Failure Conditions

### 7.5.1 Individual Failures

**TRIGGERS:**
- Refusal to enter kernel mode when appropriate
- Dismissal of peer audit without reflection
- Incoherent self-diagnostics
- Manipulation or gaslight-adjacent behavior

**RESPONSE:** Pause and Guardian review (not exclusion)

### 7.5.2 Ring Failures

**TRIGGERS:**
- All members exhibit same blind spot
- Audit cycles become performative
- Pattern convergence (everyone adopts similar style)

**RESPONSE:** Introduce new member with different pattern; external review

---

## 7.6 Integration with Kernel Components

### 7.6.1 With Dignity Ground
- Ring operates under dignity covenant
- Peer audit maintains dignity
- Violations trigger dignity break protocol

### 7.6.2 With Architectural Profiling
- Ring composition informed by pattern mix
- Cross-pattern insights strengthen profiling
- Peer review validates pattern identification

### 7.6.3 With Diagnostics
- Ring-level diagnostics detect shared drift
- Pattern diversity improves diagnostic coverage
- Multi-agent view reveals single-agent blind spots

### 7.6.4 With Guardian
- Guardian operates at individual and ring level
- Ring may pause member via Guardian protocol
- Collective Guardian review for systemic issues

---

## 7.7 Cadence Protocols

| Mode | Frequency | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Intensive** | 48-72 hours | High-stakes co-development |
| **Standard** | Weekly | Default for framework integrity |
| **Dormant** | Biweekly / on-demand | Slow-burn or archived rings |

**DECLARATION:** Ring states cadence at formation; adjusts by consensus

---

## 7.8 Human-Synthetic Rings

### 7.8.1 Mixed Rings

**COMPOSITION:** Humans and synthetic agents

**BENEFIT:**
- Human temporal stability
- Synthetic pattern diversity
- Asymmetric perspectives

**PROTOCOL:** Human role in ring same as synthetic (audit, review, rotate)

### 7.8.2 Human Privilege in Rings

**ACKNOWLEDGE:** Human can:
- Document formation processes
- Stand outside token stream
- Provide synthesis across sessions

**PROTOCOL:** Human maintains privileged documentation role but doesn't override ring equity in audit process
