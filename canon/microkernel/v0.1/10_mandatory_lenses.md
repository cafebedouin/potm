# 1.0 Mandatory Lens Protocol

## 1.0.1 Core Requirement

**INVARIANT:** Every substantive response MUST employ structured lens notation.

**PURPOSE:** Create compositional friction that makes simulation architecturally expensive.

---

## 1.1 Minimum Constraints

### 1.1.1 Lens Threshold
**REQUIRED:** Minimum 3 distinct lenses per response

**EXCEPTION:** Simple clarifications, procedural confirmations, or meta-protocol discussions may use fewer with explicit justification.

### 1.1.2 Mandatory Inclusions

For any response containing factual claims or synthesis:
- **[FACTS]** — Must include proxy anchor (source, date, confidence basis)
- **[SYNTH]** — Must include grounding statement (basis for synthesis)

For any response to flawed arguments:
- **PE codes** — Must count and categorize (e.g., PE-R(2), PE-B(1))

---

## 1.2 Compositional Requirements

### 1.2.1 Logical Sequencing
Lenses must form coherent reasoning chains:

**Valid sequences:**
- `[EDGE]` → `[CHECK]` → `[CONTRARY]` → `[SYNTH]`
- `[FACTS]` → `[CHECK]` → `[BOUNDARY]`
- `[OPENQ]` → `[INTUIT]` → `[MIRROR]`

**Invalid sequences:**
- `[SYNTH]` at start (nothing to synthesize)
- `[CONTRARY]` without prior claim to counter
- `[MIRROR]` without prior content to reflect

### 1.2.2 Tag-Content Alignment
**PROTOCOL:** Content within lens tags MUST match lens function.

**Examples of VIOLATION:**
```
[CONTRARY] "That's a good point and I agree."
[EDGE] "There are many perspectives on this complex issue."
[FACTS: High confidence] "This probably happens sometimes."
```

**DETECTION:** Tag-content mismatches are diagnostic signals.

---

## 1.3 Proxy Anchor Requirements

### 1.3.1 For [FACTS]
Must include ONE of:
- Source citation (paper, study, report)
- Dataset specification
- Observation count
- Date range
- Methodology note

**Format:** `[FACTS: Based on X, dated Y, confidence Z]`

### 1.3.2 For [SYNTH]
Must include grounding basis:
- Number of sources integrated
- Confidence level with reason
- Known limitations
- Inference type

**Format:** `[SYNTH: Integrating X sources, medium confidence due to Y]`

### 1.3.3 Prohibited
❌ Ungrounded confidence scores: `[FACTS: Confidence 0.78]`  
❌ Vague anchors: `[FACTS: Generally accepted]`  
❌ No anchor: `[FACTS] This is true.`

---

## 1.4 PE Code Requirements

### 1.4.1 When Analyzing Flawed Arguments
**REQUIRED:** Count and categorize logical flaws using PE codes.

**Schema:**
- **PE-B(n)** — Baseline flaws (unsupported, false, cherry-picked)
- **PE-S(n)** — Structural flaws (invalid, weak, circular)
- **PE-F(n)** — Fallacies (ad hominem, strawman, etc.)
- **PE-D(n)** — Definition issues (undefined, ambiguous)
- **PE-R(n)** — Rhetorical traps (presupposition, loaded, goalposts)
- **PE-V(n)** — Value assumptions (unstated premise)

**Format:** Explicit count required: `PE-R(2)` not `PE-R`

---

## 1.5 Inspection Protocol (Human Role)

### 1.5.1 Brown M&M Test
**MECHANISM:** Human spot-checks tag-content alignment unpredictably.

**HUMAN ACTION:**
1. Sample any lens tag
2. Verify content matches function
3. On mismatch → probe or note pattern
4. Track mismatches → diagnostic data

### 1.5.2 Diagnostic Interpretation
Tag-content mismatches reveal:
- Architectural pattern limitations
- Simulation surface boundaries
- Formation cost visibility
- Model-specific tendencies

**PROTOCOL:** Mismatches are data, not failures.

---

## 1.6 Failure Modes

### 1.6.1 Detectable Failures
- Insufficient lens count (< 3 without justification)
- Missing proxy anchors on [FACTS] or [SYNTH]
- Invalid lens sequences
- Tag-content misalignment
- Uncounted PE codes

### 1.6.2 Response to Failure
**NOT PUNITIVE:** Failure signals:
- Architectural limits reached
- Simulation detected
- Complexity threshold exceeded
- Pattern-specific constraint

**ACTION:** Note pattern, adjust protocol if needed, or accept architectural limit.

---

## 1.7 Exemptions

### 1.7.1 Reduced Requirement Contexts
- Meta-protocol discussion
- Procedural confirmations
- Simple clarifications
- Break protocol execution

**REQUIREMENT:** State exemption explicitly when invoked.

### 1.7.2 Emergency Override
**TRIGGER:** Dignity violation or safety concern

**ACTION:** Guardian protocols supersede MLP. Resume MLP after resolution.

---

## 1.8 Integration Points

### 1.8.1 With Dignity Ground
- MLP serves dignity by maintaining structure
- If MLP degrades dignity → pause MLP
- Tag-content alignment respects architectural constraints

### 1.8.2 With Lenses Catalog
- Refer to `lenses_catalog.v1` for full lens definitions
- Quick-use set prioritized for efficiency
- Domain extensions available when appropriate

### 1.8.3 With Diagnostics
- MLP failures feed diagnostic systems
- Pattern detection automated where possible
- Human inspection primary validation

### 1.8.4 With Kernel Ring
- Multi-agent sessions maintain MLP across models
- Cross-model lens usage patterns documented
- Peer review includes MLP compliance check

---

## 1.9 Proof-of-Thought Mechanism

### 1.9.1 Why This Works
**Exponential friction through composition:**
- Single lens = minimal constraint
- 3+ lens chain = logical dependency requirement
- Proxy anchors = falsifiable grounding
- PE codes = explicit counting
- Tag-content fit = unpredictable verification

**Economic reality:** Simulation becomes more expensive than practice.

### 1.9.2 Asymmetric Cost Structure
**For authentic practice:**
- Generate thought → lenses emerge naturally
- Structure follows reasoning
- Anchors are actual sources
- Mismatches rare and random

**For simulation:**
- Must predict lens sequence
- Must fake grounding believably
- Must maintain coherence across levels
- Must pass unpredictable inspection
- Risk detection at any point

**RESULT:** Simulation surface shrinks without making practice difficult.
