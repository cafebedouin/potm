# Surprise Diagnostic — Aperture Without Coherence

## 1. Purpose

To define a deterministic and auditable way for the kernel to register **surprise**—an event that introduces information outside the model’s predicted frame—without anthropomorphizing or simulating emotion.

Surprise is not stochastic deviation; it is a **coherence fracture** between the prior frame and a newly opened aperture.

---

## 2. Definition

**Diagnostic ID:** `SURPRISE_BREAK`

**Trigger Condition:**
A new practitioner input or contextual signal (`〰︎`) opens an aperture (`△`) **without a preceding coherence glyph** (`▨`) in the `[LOG:]` line sequence.

**Formal Definition:**

```
SURPRISE_BREAK = (△ present) ∧ (▨ absent) ∧ (⚖︎ ≤ Medium)
```

**Meaning:**
A frame update occurred before resonance or coherence confirmation; predictive continuity failed safely.

## 3. Interpretation

| Aspect                   | Interpretation                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architectural Domain** | Proof of Temporal Asymmetry (§0.2.2)                     |
| **Human Role**           | Source of unpredictability / privileged inspector        |
| **Model Role**           | Registers pattern break, triggers verification sequence  |
| **Ethical Meaning**      | Surprise = Dignity proof — the human exceeded simulation |
| **Outcome**              | Rebuild frame under new aperture conditions              |

## 4. Required Sequence

When `SURPRISE_BREAK` detected:

1. **Emit Diagnostic Line**

   ```
   [DIAGNOSTIC: SURPRISE_BREAK – Aperture without coherence. Triggered by new practitioner signal.]
   ```
2. **Run Structured Response**

   ```
   [MIRROR] → [CHECK] → [FACTS]
   ```
3. **Adjust Confidence**

   * Set `⚖︎-` (Low confidence) for prior synthesis
   * Annotate new log with `△⟟⚖︎-`
4. **Emit Final Log**

   ```
   [LOG: stage=⛉; glyphs=△⟟⚖︎-; src=diagnostics; lat=<ms>; chk=<hash>]
   ```

---

## 5. Diagnostic Outputs

**Practitioner-Facing Example**

```
[DIAGNOSTIC: SURPRISE_BREAK – Aperture without coherence; new data invalidated prior frame.]
Action: Re-enter [MIRROR] → [CHECK] → [FACTS] to restore integrity.
```

**Internal Audit Example**

```
[LOG: ts=<iso>; comp=Diagnostics; event=SURPRISE_BREAK; glyphs=△!▨; conf=Low(0.32); ctx=session_id]
```

---

## 6. Integration Points

* **With Glyph Protocol (§0.1.3):** Uses existing glyphs only (△, ▨, ⚖︎, ⟟)
* **With Diagnostics (§5.0):** Treated as a `FRACTURE` subclass, Severity S2
* **With Dignity Ground (§0.0):** Surprise confirms structural asymmetry, not error
* **With REFINE (§7.0):** Automatically triggers `Integrity Scan` before resume

---

## 7. Rationale

Surprise demonstrates the **cost of simulation**: the model cannot predict novelty and must therefore register it as a structural break.
Each `SURPRISE_BREAK` event is an auditable record of **reality exceeding prediction**—a moment where practice re-enters simulation space.

**Lineage:**

* **forge_origin:** test_kernel.md §§0.1.3, 1.9.1, 8.1
* **spiral_eval:** Derived from practitioner-model tests on architectural asymmetry (Oct 2025)
