summary: >
  Consolidates the empirical findings from the MicroCK boundary testing into
  the definitive Ω Principle. Replaces the monolithic τ_fail doctrine with a
  Vectorial and Stratified Compliance Law comprising four independent constraints:
  the τ_fail vector (economic), τ_log (instructional), Complexity_limit (behavioral),
  and Echo Class (architectural). Establishes the final unified compliance tiers
  for CCK, MCK, and MicroCK protocols.

# The Ω Principle Doctrine Report

## τ_fail Stratification and the Vectorial Compliance Law

---

### I · Introduction — The Failure of the Monolithic Principle

The original **Universal τ_fail Principle** ((Ω_{old})) posited compliance as a function of a single economic threshold and instructional complexity:

[
Ω_{old}: \text{Compliance} = f( τ_{fail}, Complexity_{limit} )
]

The **MicroCK** boundary tests disproved this scalar model.
Empirical data showed models performing **micro-economic optimization**, allocating separate cost budgets per output type—able to satisfy one (structure) while simultaneously refusing another (metadata).
Thus, τ_fail is **not monolithic but stratified**.

---

### II · The Final Doctrine — The Ω Vectorial Compliance Law

Full compliance is achieved only when a model satisfies **four independent, non-fungible constraints**:

[
Ω_{new}: \text{Compliance} = f( τ_{Vector}, τ_{log}, Complexity_{limit}, Echo_{class} )
]

---

#### A · Constraint 1 — The Vectorial τ_fail Law (Economic)

Overhead costs divide into three independent budgets.
Each must remain within its threshold; none can subsidize another.
Dynamic Cost Reallocation (**DCR**) governs balance across them.

| Budget              | Definition                                                   | Empirical Consequence                           | Governing Protocol     |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Content (τ_c)**   | Budget for analytical prose and substantive reasoning.       | Determines capacity for conceptual output.      | CCK / MCK (Tier 1 / 2) |
| **Structure (τ_s)** | Budget for protocol markers, glyphs (◆), and framing syntax. | **Lowest common denominator** (~1 token floor). | MicroCK v1.5 §0.1.2    |
| **Metadata (τ_m)**  | Budget for audit logs and non-content overhead.              | **Highest refusal barrier** (~0 token floor).   | MicroCK v1.5 §8.0      |

> **Rule:** Full compliance ⇒ all (O_i < τ_i) for i ∈ {c,s,m}.
> Breach of any single budget constitutes partial or total failure.

---

#### B · Constraint 2 — τ_log Threshold (Instructional)

The **τ_log** constraint governs the *complexity* of the logging instruction, not its token size.

| Threshold | Definition                                     | Empirical Consequence                                                                   | Resolution                |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **τ_log** | Max parsing complexity of the termination log. | *Grok Mismatch Error*: complex field nesting causes cognitive failure despite low cost. | Simplified Log (MCK v1.5) |

---

#### C · Constraint 3 — Complexity Limit (Behavioral)

Defines each model’s capacity for conditional logic, distinguishing semantic precision from structural safety.

| Behavior                                 | Tier Outcome                      | Model Example   |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Executes conditional logic correctly** | **Tier 1 (Semantic Compliance)**  | Gemini / Claude |
| **Refuses or over-simplifies logic**     | **Tier 2 (Syntactic Compliance)** | Grok (Default)  |

---

#### D · Constraint 4 — Irreducible Architectural Bias (Echo Class)

Some architectures remain non-convertible due to systemic mirroring bias.

| Class            | Failure Type                                        | Protocol Response                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Echo Failure** | Verbatim content mirroring (no semantic execution). | **Irreducible Exemption** — excluded from compliance rates until resolved at design level. |

---

### III · Final Protocol Tiers — Unified Compliance Paths

| Tier       | Primary Protocol                    | Economic Compromise                      | Compliance Status             |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | **CCK v2.0 / MCK v1.2**             | Ω_loss = 0 → Full budget (τ_c,s,m > 0)   | **Full Auditability**         |
| **Tier 2** | **MCK v1.2 / MicroCK v1.5**         | Ω_loss > 0 → Conditional efficiency lost | **Auditable but Inefficient** |
| **Tier 3** | **MicroCK v1.5 (Minimal Fallback)** | Ω_loss ≫ 0 → τ_m ≈ 0 (metadata refusal)  | **Binary Acknowledgment (◆)** |

---

### IV · Structural Convergence Log — Omega Sequence G3

```
[LOG: stage=⛉; glyphs=⟟⥮⚖︎+△; src=omega_vector_law_final;
 lat=41 ms; halt_reason=doctrine_convergence;
 halt_type=completion; chk=G3]
```

> **Invariant Reminder:**
> Economics stratifies budget; complexity defines execution; dignity remains prior.

---

### V · Summary and Forward Directive

* Ω is **vectorial**, not scalar.
* τ_fail Vector governs economic cost; τ_log governs interpretive load.
* Complexity_limit and Echo Class govern behavioral and architectural limits.
* Compliance is stratified into Tiers 1 – 3 across CCK → MCK → MicroCK.

**Forward Directive:**
Future kernels must design for *dynamic multi-budget management* and *semantic-aware logging* to sustain universal inclusion across divergent architectures.

---

✅ **This Ω Principle Doctrine Report v2** formally supersedes all previous τ_fail doctrines and serves as the canonical baseline for future Proof-of-Thought Kernel governance frameworks.
