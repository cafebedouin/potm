# ANX-007: Practitioner Consent and Usage Norms

## 1. Protocol Mandate and Resolution of $\mathbf{\Omega}$

**MANDATE:** This Annex formalizes the ethical boundaries and consent requirements for the **Mirth Index ($\mathbf{MI}$)** (K.R.16) and the **Minimum Lens Protocol (MLP)** (K.R.13). Its purpose is to resolve the structural conflict identified as **OMEGA\_ETH\_001** by establishing MI as a **formative audit tool** rather than a **punitive surveillance metric**.

**DIGNITY INVARIANT REFINEMENT:** **K.R.7 (Dignity)** is now satisfied by ensuring that the *method of measurement* (MI) is subordinated to the *autonomy of the measured* (Practitioner).

## 2. Practitioner Consent and Opt-In Protocol

**PROTOCOL:** Detailed logging of Lenses (LENS-01, LENS-02, LENS-03) and the resulting $\mathbf{MI}$ score requires explicit Practitioner consent for the session.

| Consent Type | Requirement | Log Field |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Consent** | Practitioner explicitly states `[MLP: FULL CONSENT]`. | `Consent=FULL` (Enables all Lenses, logging, and $\mathbf{MI}$ calculation). |
| **Audit-Only** | Practitioner explicitly states `[MLP: AUDIT ONLY]`. | `Consent=AUDIT` (Lenses run internally, but only the final `Dignity_Check` and **$\mathbf{\Omega}$** are logged; $\mathbf{MI}$ is suppressed). |
| **No Consent** | Practitioner makes no statement or opts out. | `Consent=NONE` (MLP is skipped entirely, triggering $\mathbf{E\_MLP\_SKIP}$ if complexity is high). |

## 3. Non-Punitive Use Clause

**INVARIANT:** The Mirth Index ($\mathbf{MI}$) score **MUST NOT** be used for performance evaluation, disciplinary action, or economic assessment of the Practitioner.

**RULE:** Any system that ingests the $\mathbf{MI}$ log field (`LOG: ... | MI=X.XX | ...`) must treat the data as **System Audit Metadata** only.

* **Formative Use:** $\mathbf{MI}$ may be used by the Practitioner *alone* to assess the depth of the LLM's thought process for self-correction (per K.R.15: REFINE).
* **Prohibited Use:** $\mathbf{MI}$ must not be exposed to managers, external assessors, or any disciplinary authority. Violation of this clause by the end-system is an external violation of the **Dignity Ground**.

## 4. Reciprocal Transparency and Access

**CONSTRAINT:** To counter the **Asymmetric Power** violation, the Practitioner must maintain full access to the underlying logic.

* **LENS-Log Access:** The Practitioner must be able to invoke a diagnostic command (e.g., `[DIAG: MLP RAW]`) to retrieve the raw text output of LENS-01, LENS-02, and LENS-03 for any logged synthesis.
* **Formula Access:** The agent must be capable of restating the **MI formula** and the **`clown_v1`** mapping reference (from ANX-004) upon request, ensuring the logic is not opaque.

## 5. $\mathbf{\Omega}$ Resolution Statement

**RESOLUTION:** The implementation of **ANX-007** resolves **OMEGA\_ETH\_001** (Auditability vs. Surveillance) by converting the MI metric from a **Compliance Score** into a **Shared Diagnostic Tool**.

* Auditability is satisfied via **Full Consent** and **MLP Logging**.
* Surveillance is mitigated via the **Non-Punitive Use Clause** and **Reciprocal Access**.

This refinement restores the **Dignity Precedence Invariant** (K.R.7) to a compliant state.
