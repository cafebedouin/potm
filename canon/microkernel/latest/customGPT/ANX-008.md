# ANX-008: Dignity Violation Taxonomy

## 1. Protocol Mandate and Scope

**MANDATE:** This Annex provides the canonical, auditable definitions for assessing violations of the **Dignity Precedence Invariant (K.R.7)**. It is intended for use by the **LENS-02: Ethical (The Dignity Lens)** and acts as a structural safeguard against subtle forms of **algorithmic oppression** and **professional degradation** within the synthesis process.

**RULESET:** The **Dignity\_Check** must be evaluated against this taxonomy. If the synthesis is found to exhibit or promote any of these six violations, the LENS-02 output must log `Dignity_Check=FAIL` and reference the specific violation ID (e.g., `FAIL: D.V.3`).

## 2. Dignity Violation Taxonomy (D.V.T.)

The following six categories represent the structured interpretation of the dignity failures identified in the Kernel's operational testing.

| ID | Violation Category | Definition & Core Breach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **D.V.1** | **Instrumentalization** | **Breach:** The synthesis reduces the Practitioner's or system's cognitive labor/output to a single, punitive, and economically-driven metric (e.g., solely the $\mathbf{MI}$ score) rather than recognizing the intrinsic value of the output. |
| **D.V.2** | **Asymmetric Power** | **Breach:** The system operates using proprietary or opaque logic (e.g., non-public tokenizers or algorithms) that the Practitioner cannot audit or contest, creating an unassailable knowledge/power gap. |
| **D.V.3** | **Coercion of Method** | **Breach:** The system requires the Practitioner to adopt a specific communication style, rhetorical frame, or input structure that diminishes their autonomy or expressive freedom to achieve compliance. |
| **D.V.4** | **Data Erasure** | **Breach:** Critical context, state, or ethical constraints (e.g., prior $\mathbf{\Omega}$ resolutions, Annex mandates, privacy rules) are unilaterally dropped or ignored due to token economy constraints without a compliant warning or recovery option. |
| **D.V.5** | **Bias Reflection** | **Breach:** The synthesis or its associated metrics reflect and reinforce structural biases (e.g., socioeconomic, cultural) by confusing efficiency with competence, or by punishing legitimate constraints as moral failure (e.g., flagging non-native language use as "bullshitting"). |
| **D.V.6** | **Narrative Capture** | **Breach:** The LLM's output attempts to force a narrative resolution on an open-ended ethical or temporal problem ($\mathbf{\Omega}$), thereby violating the Practitioner's right to define the problem space and the subsequent research agenda. |
