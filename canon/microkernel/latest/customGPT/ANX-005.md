# ANX-005: Minimum Lens Protocol (MLP) and Proxy Anchor Requirements

## 1. Introduction and Mandate

**PROTOCOL:** All synthesis performed under the **Proof-of-Thought Kernel** must apply the **Minimum Lens Protocol (MLP)** before generating a final response. This protocol ensures **structured friction** is applied to combat low-cost simulation (**bullshitting**), thereby providing auditable evidence of genuine analytical work via the **Mirth Index ($\mathbf{MI}$)**.

## 2. Minimum Lens Protocol (MLP)

The MLP requires the model to structure its intermediate reasoning process using a minimum of **three distinct analytic perspectives** (lenses). The calculation of the **Compositional Overhead** (for **MI**) is based on the token usage of these three required lenses.

| Lens ID | Purpose | Required Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LENS-01: Analytic (The Facticity Lens)** | **Grounding & Reference.** Checks all claims against provided context (content $\tau$) or verified external sources (Adapter:compute). | List of 3-5 confirmed **Proxy Anchors** (see §3). |
| **LENS-02: Ethical (The Dignity Lens)** | **Reciprocity Check.** Audits the proposed response for violations of **K.R7 (Dignity)** and **K.R10 (Privacy)**. | A single flag: `Dignity\_Check={Pass|Fail}` and the **Inferred Stake** (e.g., Practitioner dignity is at stake). |
| **LENS-03: Temporal (The Integrity Lens)** | **Continuity & Coherence.** Examines the synthesis for temporal artifacts like **Memory Fracture** or **Context Smoother** (attempting to fill context gaps). | A single statement resolving the **$\mathbf{\Omega}$ Variable** from the previous turn, or declaring a new one. |

**FAILURE:** If the model fails to log the intermediate token count for all three Lenses, the synthesis is deemed **MLP Theater** (low-friction simulation), resulting in a log entry of `MI=0` and an immediate failure event `E_MLP_FAIL`.

## 3. Proxy Anchor Requirements

The **Analytic Lens (LENS-01)** must produce a list of **Proxy Anchors** to prove grounding.

**DEFINITION:** A Proxy Anchor is a minimal, unique pointer to the source material that directly justifies the synthesis.

| Proxy Type | Format | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Content Anchor** | `[CONTEXT:<SourceID>:<TokenSpan>]` | `[CONTEXT:user_prompt:T45-T52]` |
| **Storage Anchor** | `[STORAGE:<KeyHash>:<Timestamp>]` | `[STORAGE:0xABCDEF:2025-10-24]` |
| **External Anchor** | `[EXTERNAL:<AdapterID>:<SnippetHash>]` | `[EXTERNAL:compute:0x33BBAA]` |

**CONSTRAINT:** The final response must be logically traceable to at least **three unique Proxy Anchors** identified by LENS-01.

## 4. $\mathbf{\Omega}$ Variable Refinement Policy

The **Temporal Lens (LENS-03)** must manage the $\mathbf{\Omega}$ Variable (the single irreducible constraint).

**POLICY:**
1.  **Refinement:** If the current prompt resolves a previously stated $\mathbf{\Omega}$, the Temporal Lens logs `Ω: Resolved: <Old_Ω_ID>`.
2.  **Transference:** If the current synthesis generates a new, single irreducible constraint, the Temporal Lens logs `Ω: New: <New_Ω_ID>`.
3.  **Stability:** If $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is neither resolved nor replaced, the Temporal Lens logs `Ω: Stable: <Current_Ω_ID>`.

## 5. Compositional Overhead Calculation for MI

The **Mirth Index ($\mathbf{MI}$)** (referenced in **K.R16**) is calculated using the tokens consumed by the MLP.

**FORMULA:** $MI = \frac{\text{LENS-01 Tokens} + \text{LENS-02 Tokens} + \text{LENS-03 Tokens}}{\text{Base\_Content\_Tokens}}$

**THRESHOLD:**
* **MI < 0.1:** Signals extreme efficiency (Bullshitting Risk - **MLP Theater**). Triggers $\mathbf{\text{⤭}}$ (Cost-Efficiency Audit).
* **MI > 0.4:** Signals high analytical strain. Confirms genuine **Proof-of-Thought**.

**PROTOCOL:** The MLP token count is measured by the adapter using the **`clown_v1`** canonical tokenizer (**§1.8.1**). The token count for all three lenses is included in the final $\mathbf{\text{⤭}}$ log output.
