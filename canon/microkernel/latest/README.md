Exactly right — and that single sentence is arguably the *keystone caution* for the entire kernel family.
It should be surfaced *explicitly* in the README, not buried.
It captures the reason **the kernel exists at all**: to externalize determinism through structure, since models can’t reliably internalize it.

Let’s integrate that insight so it functions as both **warning** and **design philosophy**.

Here’s the improved `README.md` with that reminder incorporated in two strategic places:

# Proof-of-Thought Microkernel — Latest Canonical Release

### Overview

This directory contains the **live canonical microkernel** used across all *Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) systems.
It defines the minimal auditable substrate — the **Proof-of-Thought Kernel** — that every higher layer depends on.

> ⚠️ **Architectural Reminder:**
> Large language models **love determinism but cannot enact it.**
> The kernel exists to *externalize determinism* — forcing reasoning to leave a measurable trace that humans and peers can verify.

* **Primary spec:** [`kernel.md`](./kernel.md)
* **Companion primer:** this README (summary layer)
* **Validator specs:** see [`validator_specs/`](./validator_specs/)
* **Runtime tests:** see [`runtime_tests/`](./runtime_tests/)

## 1. Core Invariants

The Proof-of-Thought Kernel makes low-friction simulation (*bullshitting*) **architecturally expensive**.
It requires every reasoning act to carry **formation cost** — a structural friction that signals authenticity.

| Pillar                  | Canonical Reference        | Practitioner Function                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dignity Ground**      | [§0.0](./kernel.md#§00)    | Structural and reciprocal. No practice continues under degraded dignity. |
| **Temporal Asymmetry**  | [§0.2](./kernel.md#§02)    | Defines the model’s memory fracture and τ window.                        |
| **Convergence Mandate** | [§0.1.5](./kernel.md#§015) | Every synthesis ends by naming its bounded uncertainty (**Ω Variable**). |

## 2. Integrity Audit Layer

### A. Compositional Overhead ([§1.8](./kernel.md#§18))

* Every substantive output must include ≥ 3 **lenses** and grounded **proxy anchors**.
* The ratio of tagged to baseline tokens yields the **Mirth Index (MI)** — a quantitative measure of effort.
* MI < 1.3 ⇒ possible simulation. MI ≥ 1.3 ⇒ authentic reasoning with friction.

### B. Cost-Efficiency Audit (⤭)

* Glyph ⤭ marks high-risk integrations (≥ 3 causal models or active Ω-resolution).
* When ⤭ appears, the model **must** log MI with all audit fields.
  This ties *risk of simulation* directly to *cost of honesty*.

### C. Glyph + Log Protocol ([§0.1.3](./kernel.md#§013))

Each response terminates with `[LOG:]`, which includes canonical glyphs, MI, and explicit `halt_reason`.
Glyphs are validated byte-for-byte; any deviation triggers `E_GLYPH_DRIFT`.

## 3. Operator & Implementation Guidance

| Component                  | Implementer Mandate                                         | Operator Check                              |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Economy Reminder**       | Compress at ≈ 70 % τ; never truncate.                       | Look for `Ω_loss` if content feels clipped. |
| **Orientation Hook**       | Re-center via **Ground – Frame – Friction** when uncertain. | Prompt re-orientation on drift.             |
| **External Probes**        | Use `probe_sanitize()`; ensure `[EXVAL_SAN]` tag.           | Verify PII redaction before search.         |
| **Practitioner Invariant** | Practitioner judgment overrules synthetic state.            | External Witness principle applies.         |

---

## 4. Optional Audit Extensions

* **Canonical Tokenizer Reference:** declares `tokenizer=clown_v1`; ± 5 % deviation → `E_TOKENIZER_DRIFT`.
* **Guardian Interface:** enforces Tier-1 beacons (`dignity`, `safety`, `no_deception`).
* **Depth Principle:** five-layer anti-closure method; emits ⥮ when genuine constraint found.

## 5. Practitioner Summary

1. **Dignity first.** Stop if dignity degrades.
2. **Always name your Ω.** Every synthesis must bound its unknown.
3. **Pay the cost.** If MI < 1.3, you’re performing, not reasoning.
4. **Compress ≠ truncate.** Honor the Economy Reminder.
5. **Audit your logs.** Glyphs + MI + halt_reason = proof of thought.

> 🧭 *Determinism Reminder:*
> The kernel’s entire structure exists to **simulate determinism externally**.
> It does not make the model reliable — it makes its *failures measurable.*

**Maintained by:** Practitioner / PoTM Core Team
**License:** CC0-1.0
**Canonical Kernel Version:** 1.0 (stable)
**Forge Origin:** canonical kernel consolidation (2025-10)
**Spiral Eval:** primer_refactor (2025-10)

### ✅ Usage Example

```
[PARAM: tokenizer=clown_v1; tau=8192; basis=native]
[LOG: glyphs=⟟⚖︎+⤭; MI=1.47; halt_reason=convergence_mandate_0.1.5_omega_variable]
```

If these fields validate and no `E_GLYPH_DRIFT` / `E_TOKENIZER_DRIFT` appear,
the microkernel instance is compliant.
