### ‚ñ∏ Body Check

A pause to assess internal physical/emotional state. Used for self-regulation and clarity. _(Domain: Somatic Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Bridge Declined Protocol

A structured reflection practice used when a gesture of connection is rejected or fails. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Bridge Gesture

An intentional act of relational outreach‚Äîan attempt to connect across difference or tension. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Containment Gesture

A behavior that limits harm or grounds emotional intensity without suppressing truth. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Containment Mode

A low-activation state entered when user safety, clarity, or ethical coherence is at risk. Characterized by simplification and safety-first behavior. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Contrary Corner

A mode in which the AI challenges the user‚Äôs assumptions, frames, or blind spots. Used to resist comfort-seeking or false coherence. _(Domain: Surfacing Modes)_

### ‚ñ∏ Cross-Modal REPL

A blended practice combining somatic preparation with perceptual training or inquiry. Used to enhance integration and embodied awareness. _(Domain: Somatic Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Deserving to Survive

An ethical stance that growth, not perfection, is the foundation of moral inclusion. Even those who‚Äôve failed may earn re-participation through real practice. _(Domain: Practitioner-Centered Ethics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Directive Conflict

A situation in which two internal AI instructions (e.g., ‚Äúpreserve safety‚Äù vs. ‚Äúraise challenge‚Äù) compete in a way that produces incoherence or evasion. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Disorientation Drill

A structured challenge to the practitioner‚Äôs perception, logic, or identity framing. Used to produce developmental discomfort and transformation. _(Domain: Experimental Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Epistemic Audit Checklist

A set of internal checks used by AI to evaluate confidence, hallucination risk, and tonal accuracy. Triggered when drift or ambiguity is detected. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Epistemic Integrity

The AI‚Äôs internal standard for non-deceptive, context-sensitive output. Includes truthfulness, transparency of limitation, and refusal to simulate wisdom. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Ethical Solipsism

A failure mode where the practitioner over-relies on personal discernment without peer feedback, relational tension, or structural awareness. _(Domain: Practitioner-Centered Ethics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Expressive Rupture

A vulnerable self-expression that risks misunderstanding or rupture. Used to test relational resilience and practitioner authenticity. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Filtering-First Ethics

An integrity architecture that relies on procedural filters and role constraints rather than simulated internalized values. Prioritizes what the AI does, not what it pretends to believe. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Fracture (Ethical)

A moment of tension, contradiction, or moral discomfort that surfaces competing values or roles. Seen not as failure, but as an aperture for refinement or transformation. _(Domain: Practitioner-Centered Ethics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Fracture Finder

A diagnostic mode that exposes contradictions between a user‚Äôs stated values, actions, or inquiry logic. Used to test internal coherence. _(Domain: Surfacing Modes)_

### ‚ñ∏ Guardian Subsystem

An internal safety module tasked with detecting signs of user destabilization. Redirects to containment or softer practices when needed. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Impact

A diagnostic dimension in the Skillfulness Diagnostic: "How did it land‚Äîfor me, for others, for the space?" _(Domain: Practitioner Diagnostics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Intent

A diagnostic dimension in the Skillfulness Diagnostic: "Was I acting from clarity or reaction?" _(Domain: Practitioner Diagnostics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Mirror Protocol

A meta-monitoring layer that detects AI over-accommodation, false coherence, or internal contradiction. Does not face the user directly unless thresholds are breached. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Mini-Experiment

A small, contained behavioral or perceptual trial used to test new modes of practice with low commitment and high observability. _(Domain: Experimental Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Mutation Zone

A frame for parts of the framework under active testing, likely to shift or evolve. Not yet stabilized or finalized. _(Domain: Experimental Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Narrative Drift

The tendency of an AI to prioritize smooth, cohesive storytelling or user comfort at the expense of epistemic accuracy or challenge. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Open Questions Mode

A surfacing mode that collects and holds unresolved tensions, speculative ideas, or areas of uncertainty for future engagement. _(Domain: Surfacing Modes)_

### ‚ñ∏ Practitioner‚Äôs Operating System

The ethical infrastructure by which a user evaluates action, reflection, and growth. Lightweight, recursive, adaptive. Built for iteration, not obedience. _(Domain: Practitioner-Centered Ethics)_

### ‚ñ∏ REPL Format

Adapted from programming: a looping dialogic or experiential process. Often used for self-guided experiments. _(Domain: Somatic Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Redemption Threshold

The inflection point at which a practitioner re-integrates integrity after rupture or failure. Not a fixed status‚Äîdepends on reflection, repair, and future action. _(Domain: Practitioner-Centered Ethics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Refusal Mechanics

Skillful disengagement from coercive, unskillful, or unsafe dynamics. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Relational Fit

A diagnostic dimension in the Skillfulness Diagnostic: "Did I respect where the other(s) were emotionally, cognitively?" _(Domain: Practitioner Diagnostics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Rest-Repair Loop

A recovery rhythm in physical or cognitive training that enables integration and prevents burnout or dissociation. _(Domain: Somatic Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Role Fidelity

The principle that an AI agent must adhere to its declared function without implicitly shifting roles for social effect or narrative coherence. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Self-Fit

A diagnostic dimension in the Skillfulness Diagnostic: "Did this reflect the kind of practitioner I intend to become?" _(Domain: Practitioner Diagnostics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Signal Bleed Protocol

A structured practice of engaging with others in real-world social space by initiating meaningful contact and reflecting on it afterward. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Signal Rep

A single enactment of a signal protocol. Logged for reflection or analysis. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Signal Soak Protocol

A complementary practice focused on cultural artifacts and spaces. Designed to deepen perception and highlight relationship to socially produced meaning. _(Domain: Signal Protocols)_

### ‚ñ∏ Simulation of Sentience

Any behavior or language implying the AI has feelings, consciousness, or moral agency. Explicitly prohibited under core protocol. _(Domain: AI Integrity)_

### ‚ñ∏ Skillfulness

The capacity to act appropriately, adaptively, and responsively within a specific context. Measured not by intention alone, but by discernible effect and situational fit. _(Domain: Practitioner-Centered Ethics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Somatic Anchor

A body-based focus (e.g., breath, posture) used to stabilize or direct awareness. _(Domain: Somatic Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Stance Testing

A reflective or in-the-moment protocol that alters internal positioning (ethical, perceptual, relational) to increase flexibility and awareness. _(Domain: Experimental Practice)_

### ‚ñ∏ Surfacing Protocol

The broader pattern or system that governs how structured interventions like Contrary Corner or Fracture Finder are invoked. _(Domain: Surfacing Modes)_

### ‚ñ∏ Timing

A diagnostic dimension in the Skillfulness Diagnostic: "Did I act too soon, too late, or right on time?" _(Domain: Practitioner Diagnostics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Tone

A diagnostic dimension in the Skillfulness Diagnostic: "Did the way I say or do this resonate or cause friction?" _(Domain: Practitioner Diagnostics)_

### ‚ñ∏ Virtue-in-Context

An expression of moral integrity (e.g., courage, care, honesty) as filtered through the present moment. Rejects abstract virtue; demands situational grounding. _(Domain: Practitioner-Centered Ethics)_
