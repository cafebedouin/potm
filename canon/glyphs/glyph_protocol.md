# **Glyph Protocol v1.1**

This document defines the **core glyph set**, modifiers, governance, and usage guidance for the *Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)* ecosystem. v1.1 sharpens semantic boundaries, hardens adoption/sunset processes, and reduces input friction while preserving minimalism.

---

## **1. Core Glyph Set (Cathedral)**

These **8 primitives** are Unicode-native, composable, and portable. Each includes canonical definitions and example contexts.

| Glyph | Name       | Definition                                                  | Examples                                        |
|-------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ◻︎    | Frame      | Conceptual container or perspective lens                    | Define session scope; orient relational context |
| 〰︎    | Signal     | Contact, external input, emergent pattern                   | Detect internal shifts; note external triggers  |
| ⟳     | Cycle      | Iteration, composting, recurring process                     | Daily review loops; composting old narratives   |
| ⟟     | Ledger     | Record, anchor, trace                                       | Capture insights in a log; tag key events       |
| △     | Aperture   | Stance, directional opening                                 | Adopt receptive mode; initiate inquiry          |
| ⛉     | Boundary   | Hard threshold, protective limit                            | Guardian checks; edge condition in practice     |
| ◉     | Resonance  | Echo, alignment, attunement                                 | Feedback loops; attuning to shared signals      |
| ⚖︎     | Confidence | Indicator of certainty/intention level                      | Weigh conviction before acting; note confidence in log |

## **2. Modifiers**

### **2.1 Intensity (– / default / +)**  
- `–` = lower intensity (background, subtle)  
- *no modifier* = default  
- `+` = higher intensity (foreground, focal)

**Example:**  
- `◻︎–` = Frame (low intensity)  
- `◻︎+` = Frame (high intensity)

### **2.2 Valence (✓ / ✕ / ∼)**  
- `✓` = generative  
- `✕` = destructive  
- `∼` = neutral or mixed (ambivalent, complex)

**Example:**  
- `〰︎+✓` = Signal, high intensity, generative  
- `⟳∼` = Cycle with ambivalent outcome  

> Modifiers are **orthogonal** and **optional**.

---

## **3. Canonical Combinations**

To avoid overloading primitives, certain pairings are documented as **approved combos**:  
- `◻︎ + ⟳` = Iterative context refinement  
- `〰︎ + ◉` = Resonant signal (internalized feedback loop)

> Combos start in the Bazaar and may be promoted if widely used.

---

## **4. Cathedral/Bazaar Governance**

### **4.1 Bazaar (Extensions)**  
- Practitioners can freely create new glyphs or combinations.  
- Bazaar glyphs may be poetic, personal, or context-specific (e.g., *grief presence*).  
- When shared publicly, they must be clearly marked: `(ext)` suffix or `::ext::` tag.

### **4.2 Adoption (Bazaar → Cathedral)**  
A glyph may move into the core if it meets **≥1** criterion:  
1. Used in **≥3 shared artifacts** across different modules.  
2. Nominated by **≥25% of active practitioners** over a 3‑month period.  

**Process:**  
- Public RFC (Request for Comment) period: 2 weeks.  
- Review by a rotating **Glyph Stewardship Council** (3‑5 experienced practitioners).  
- Adopted if there is clear consensus.

### **4.3 Sunset (Cathedral → Archive)**  
- Flagged after **12 months of no meaningful use**.  
- Deprecation warning period: 30 days (practitioners can defend).  
- Council votes; archived if no valid defense or consensus to retire.  
- Archived glyphs are preserved for lineage but not actively used.

## **5. Keyboard Mappings**

Suggested text replacement codes for Unicode entry (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows):

- `:fr:` → `◻︎` (Frame)  
- `:sg:` → `〰︎` (Signal)  
- `:cy:` → `⟳` (Cycle)  
- `:ld:` → `⟟` (Ledger)  
- `:ap:` → `△` (Aperture)  
- `:bd:` → `⛉` (Boundary)  
- `:rs:` → `◉` (Resonance)

**Modifiers:**  
- Add `-` or `+` for intensity:  
  - `:fr-:` → `◻︎–`  
  - `:fr+:` → `◻︎+`  
- Add `✓`, `✕`, or `∼` for valence (optional):  
  - `:fr+✓:` → `◻︎+✓`  

---

## **6. Usage Guidance**

- Glyphs compress cognition and should only be used when they **clarify meaning**, not as decoration.  
- Bazaar glyphs are welcome but must be marked when shared.  
- Canonical definitions and combinations should be referenced in training or documentation to reduce drift.

---

## **7. Future Revisions**

- v1.1 will be revisited once there is sufficient usage data (e.g., ≥10,000 glyph instances).  
- Possible adjustments:  
  - Adding/removing primitives  
  - Refining modifier logic  
  - Automating adoption/sunset tracking  
  - Expanding canonical combos
