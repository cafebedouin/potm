### **On the Relationship Between `microkernel/` and `practitioner/`**

The distinction between these directories is not about *technology* (AI vs. human), but about *function* within a universal system design.

**1. Formal System — `microkernel/`**
Holds the invariant, axiomatic, and procedural elements of PoTM.

* This is the canonical specification of the framework’s logic.
* It can be executed by any substrate capable of following procedural rules: a computer, a paper manual, a set of workshop instructions, or even a spoken tradition.
* Its purpose is to preserve logical consistency and repeatability, regardless of who or what carries it out.

**2. Interpretive System — `practitioner/`**
Holds the tools, guides, and methods for translating the formal system into situated action.

* This layer works in the domain of narrative, metaphor, emotion, and contextual judgment.
* It is designed for interpretive agents (humans, groups, organizations) and adapts the formal rules to the lived complexity of specific contexts.
* Its purpose is to facilitate *application*, not to restate the formal system verbatim.

**3. Bidirectional Feedback Loop**
These layers are not one-way.

* The practitioner layer is a primary source of feedback that can refine, challenge, or extend the formal system.
* Changes in lived practice inform the evolution of the formal specification, ensuring PoTM remains adaptive and relevant.

**Summary**
Think of `microkernel/` as the **formal contract** of the system, and `practitioner/` as the **human-facing API**. One preserves precision; the other ensures engagement and relevance. Together, they form a substrate-agnostic architecture that can operate in purely human, purely machine, or hybrid environments without loss of coherence.
