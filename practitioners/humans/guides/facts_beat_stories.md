# üìù Facts Beat Stories
*A Quick Guide to Feeling Less Stuck*

---

## The Main Idea

Most of our pain comes from the stories we tell ourselves, not from what actually happened.

**Stories add drama:** "I'm a complete failure and nothing ever works out for me."

**Facts are simple:** "I didn't get the job I wanted."

When you focus on facts instead of stories, problems feel smaller and solutions become clearer.

## Step 1: Catch the Story

**Look for these warning signs:**
- Words like "always," "never," "everyone," or "no one"
- Dramatic language like "disaster," "ruined," or "terrible"
- Mind-reading: "They think I'm stupid"
- Fortune-telling: "This will never work out"

**If you hear these ‚Üí you've found a story.**

## Step 2: Find the Simple Fact

**Ask yourself:** What exactly happened?

**Story:** "I'm horrible at relationships."
**Fact:** "My girlfriend and I broke up yesterday."

**Story:** "I always mess everything up."
**Fact:** "I forgot to send that email on time."

**Remember:** Facts are short and don't need blame or excuses.

## Step 3: Pick One Quick Tool

**Drop the Name-Calling** ‚Üí Remove words like "stupid," "lazy," or "failure"

**Reality Check** ‚Üí Ask: "Is this happening right now, or am I worried it might?"

**Tell Someone** ‚Üí Share just the plain fact with someone who cares

**Make a List** ‚Üí Write down what you've been avoiding, without explaining why

## Step 4: Stop There

- Don't add "but" or "because" after stating the fact
- Let the simple truth just sit there
- Notice how your body feels when you drop the big story
- See what becomes possible when the drama quiets down

---

## Why This Works

- **Facts are lighter** - they don't weigh you down with shame
- **Facts can be shared** - others can help when they know what actually happened  
- **Facts show options** - stories make you feel trapped, facts show what you can do next
- **Facts are manageable** - you can work with what's real

---

## Try This Right Now

**Write down:**
1. "The story I keep telling myself is..."
2. "The simple fact is..."

**Notice:** How different do these feel in your body?

## Remember

**Stories grow suffering. Facts shrink it.**

Next time you feel stuck, ask: "What's the plain truth here?" Then work with that instead of the big dramatic story.

**You don't have to believe every thought that crosses your mind.**
