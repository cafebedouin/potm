# Preventive Maintenance Atlas
*Version 1.0 - Practitioner Guide*

## Purpose
This atlas maps domains where silent drift creates disproportionate problems. Use it to build your own preventive practice - not as a checklist to complete, but as terrain to navigate based on your circumstances.

**Flag** = High-leverage items that prevent large problems with small attention  
**Defer** = Practitioner must scope based on personal situation, values, risk tolerance

## Practitioner Approaches

This atlas is terrain, not instructions. Different practitioners engage with maintenance differently based on temperament and life phase.

### Engagement Modes

**Calendar Mode** → Schedule recurring reminders for chosen items. Works well for practitioners who thrive on systematic routines.

**Trigger Mode** → Run checks when anxiety, disruption, or specific signals appear. Suits practitioners who respond better to present-moment cues than predetermined schedules.

**Project Mode** → Cluster related practices into seasonal focuses (e.g., "summer health overhaul" or "winter relationship deepening"). Appeals to practitioners who prefer intensive bursts over steady maintenance.

**Reflection Mode** → Use retreats, journaling sessions, or values reviews as entry points to assess multiple domains simultaneously. Fits contemplative practitioners who prefer integrated self-examination.

### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Scan for Resonance** - Notice which flagged items spark recognition, anxiety, or resistance. Treat these signals as guidance, not obligation.

**Step 2: Choose Your Mode** - Pick the engagement approach that matches your natural rhythms and current life demands.

**Step 3: Track Cross-Domain Effects** - Problems migrate between domains. Financial stress disrupts sleep; relationship drift drains professional energy. Use these connections to prioritize attention.

**Step 4: Adjust to Life Phase** - New parents, career changers, and retirees need different maintenance rhythms. The atlas provides starting frequencies, but your situation determines actual cadence.

**Step 5: Expand Sustainably** - Add new domains only after current practices stabilize. Consistency in fewer areas beats sporadic attention across many.

## Key Principles

**Autonomy First**: You choose what matters for your situation. This is terrain to navigate, not instructions to follow.

**High-Leverage Focus**: Small attention in these areas prevents large problems later. Most have exponential rather than linear returns.

**Cross-Domain Awareness**: Problems rarely stay contained. Health affects relationships, finances affect mental state, skills affect security.

**Sustainable Rhythms**: Better to maintain 3 practices consistently than attempt 15 sporadically.

**Seasonal Adjustment**: Life phases require different maintenance priorities. Adjust accordingly.

**Confidence**: 85% that consistent attention to 3-5 flagged domains prevents most silent drift problems.

**Proxy**: Whether practitioners catch issues at "manageable inconvenience" rather than "major crisis" stage.
