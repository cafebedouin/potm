# Gaslighting: When Someone Makes You Doubt Your Own Reality

Maya started keeping notes on her phone after talks with her partner. Not romantic notes — reality checks.  

After difficult conversations, she’d find herself wondering:  
*“Did I really overreact? Am I too sensitive? Did I remember wrong?”*  

Looking back, she saw the pattern:  
- Concerns dismissed  
- Clear memories denied  
- Every issue made her fault  

She wasn’t “losing it” — she was being gaslighted.

## What Gaslighting Really Is

**Gaslighting** is a repeated pattern of making someone doubt their perception, memory, or judgment.  
It’s not a single disagreement or different perspective — it’s a sustained erosion of your trust in yourself.

It can happen in:
- Romantic relationships  
- Families  
- Friendships  
- Workplaces  

Intent may be conscious or unconscious — the effect is the same: you start trusting yourself less.

## Common Forms

1. **Denial** — “I never said that. You’re remembering wrong.”  
2. **Minimizing** — “You’re overreacting. It was just a joke.”  
3. **Blame-shifting** — “If you weren’t so critical, I wouldn’t have done that.”  
4. **Historical weaponization** — Using past mistakes to discredit current concerns.  
5. **Isolation twist** — “Everyone thinks you’re overreacting” (true or not).  

---

## Why It Works

Gaslighting targets your ability to trust your own experience. It’s especially disorienting when:
- You care about the person’s opinion  
- They sound confident  
- You’ve been taught to doubt yourself  
- You lack other perspectives  
- Manipulation is mixed with affection  

---

## Spotting the Pattern

- **Body check** — Do you feel smaller, anxious, or unsure after conversations with them?  
- **Reality gap** — Do they consistently “correct” your memories in ways that make you doubt yourself?  
- **Emotional dismissal** — Are your feelings repeatedly labeled as “too much” or “too sensitive”?  
- **One-way blame** — Are you always at fault, never them?  
- **Moving goalposts** — Do rules or expectations keep shifting?

## What You Can Do

**1. Document your reality.**  
Keep private notes: what happened, what was said, how you felt.  

**2. Seek outside perspective.**  
Talk to trusted friends, family, or a counselor — gaslighting thrives in isolation.  

**3. Stop defending your reality.**  
You don’t need to prove your feelings or memories are valid.  

**4. Set conversational boundaries.**  
Use phrases like:  
- “I remember it differently.”  
- “We’re not going to agree on this.”  

**5. Trust your discomfort.**  
If something feels off, treat that as data.

## Rebuilding Confidence

- Start small: Trust your perception about everyday things.  
- Spend time with people who respect your reality.  
- Practice stating your experience without justification:  
  - “That doesn’t feel right to me.”  
  - “That’s not my experience.”

## When to Seek Professional Help

If gaslighting is part of an important relationship — especially if it’s escalating — talk to a counselor, therapist, or advocate.

Resources:
- **National Domestic Violence Hotline** (U.S.): 1-800-799-7233  
- Confidential support, even if you’re unsure it “counts” as abuse.

## Common Questions

**What if I *am* remembering wrong sometimes?**  
That’s normal. Look for consistent, one-sided patterns from one person.

**What if they don’t mean to do it?**  
Impact matters more than intent — the harm is the same.

**What if I’ve done this too?**  
Occasional defensiveness is different from a sustained pattern of distortion.

**How do I bring it up?**  
Be careful — direct confrontation can escalate the behavior. Prioritize safety and outside support first.

**Remember:**  
You are the expert on your own experience. Trust that expertise, even when someone tries to convince you otherwise.
