# Intro to Practice Cards — Five Lenses Anywhere

This file shows how one small card can teach the whole PoTM card system:

1. start simple, 2) expand when useful, 3) connect to the larger framework.

---

## The card (smallest unit)

**Card: Five Lenses Anywhere**
**Practice:** View one thing through five frames — **literal, associative, structural, when/where, larger meaning/represents**.
**Use When:** You have a little time and a steady scene.
**Remember:** The **shift** is the training, not “getting it right.”

---

## Quick start (2 minutes)

1. Pick one anchor (object/scene/sound).
2. Spend \~20–30s per lens:

   * **Literal:** What’s *here*? (facts only)
   * **Associative:** What does it call up? (memories/feelings)
   * **Structural:** How is it made / how does it work?
   * **When/Where:** When and where does this belong? How has it changed?
   * **Larger Meaning / Represents:** What does it stand for or mean?
3. Close: one sentence on what shifted.

---

## Worked example: Movie Theater Screen

**Anchor:** Movie theater before previews.

* **Literal:** Large blank screen, closed curtains, dimmed lights, rows of stadium seating.
* **Associative:** Seeing *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World* with friends; waiting for *Mean Girls* to begin; smell of popcorn drifting through the lobby.
* **Structural:** Projection booth above; sound system hidden in the walls; tiered rows for clear sightlines.
* **When/Where:** Grand movie palaces of the early 20th century; midnight cult screenings in the 2000s–2010s; current mix of blockbusters and streaming.
* **Larger Meaning / Represents:** Shared cultural storytelling space; a place where strangers laugh, gasp, and quote the same lines; a living contrast to watching alone on a phone screen.

**What shifted?** The “blank screen” became a living cultural landmark — part architecture, part technology, part social ritual.

---

## Going beyond the card (digital + kernel)

When run in a PoTM-aware app or custom kernel, the same card can:

* **Auto-prompt** each lens with a timer.
* **Offer examples** pulled from your past sessions.
* **Vary the set** (e.g., only *literal + structural* when short on time).
* **Log** your notes and show change over time.
* **Chain** into other moves (e.g., end with *Unshielded Ear* if a person enters).

---

## How this ties into PoTM

**Core maxims in motion**

* **Clarity > fluency:** Literal lens trains seeing before storytelling.
* **Precision > certainty:** Five small, precise passes beat one confident gloss.
* **Challenge is care:** Structural/larger-meaning lenses surface deeper truths gently.
* **Don’t continue a non-generative loop:** If a lens stalls, shift or end.

**Thinking Style Map bridges**

* **Following a Plan:** run the card as written.
* **Making Your Own Exercise:** add or swap a lens (e.g., “ethical lens”).
* **Looking Back and Forward:** apply the lenses to a memory or plan.
* **Watching Your Own Mind:** notice which lens you overuse; practice its opposite.

---

## Variations (pick one)

* **Micro:** Do only **Literal + Structural**. 60–90s.
* **Story first:** Start with Larger Meaning, then back down to Literal to test it.
* **Social:** Run the lenses on a conversation dynamic rather than an object.
* **Invert:** “How *not* to see this?” (name likely distortions, then clear them).
* **Timeline zoom:** Do only When/Where with a quick historical sketch.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **“I drift into analysis.”** Set a timer; keep each lens brief and discrete.
* **“Larger Meaning feels vague.”** Try: “What does this stand for in my life?”
* **“I get stuck.”** Skip a lens; come back next session.
* **“No time.”** Do Literal only for 30s. Still counts.

---

## Micro-metrics

After any session, jot one line:

* **One new detail I noticed:** \_\_\_\_\_\_
* **One lens I underused:** \_\_\_\_\_\_
* **One place to try this next:** \_\_\_\_\_\_

---

## FAQ

**How long does it take?**
From 60 seconds to 20 minutes. You choose.

**Where can I use it?**
Anywhere: waiting rooms, walks, train rides, work breaks.

**Is this meditation?**
It’s an attention drill. It can feel meditative, but it stays practical.

**Do I need all five lenses every time?**
No. Two or three is fine. The *switching* is the skill.

Do you want me to now also update the **README compact version** we made earlier so it inherits the *Scott Pilgrim / Mean Girls* references and matches this YAML ID for consistency? That way the short and long forms will be linked in the repo.
