# ðŸŒŠ Feelings Check-In

**What this is:**
A simple way to notice and stay with your feelings instead of pushing them away. Use it when emotions feel confusing, overwhelming, or stuck.

**Why it matters:**
Most of us learned to think our way out of feelings or stay busy to avoid them. But feelings have important information. This check-in helps you listen to what they're trying to tell you.

## âœ… Five Simple Steps

### 1. What am I feeling right now?

**Good sign:** I can name it simply - "worried," "sad," "excited," "tired."

**Warning sign:** I say "fine" or "I don't know" when clearly something's going on.

### 2. Where do I feel it in my body?

**Good sign:** I notice specific spots - tight chest, heavy shoulders, butterflies in stomach.

**Warning sign:** I'm completely disconnected from physical sensations.

### 3. Am I trying to make this feeling go away?

**Good sign:** I can sit with uncomfortable feelings without immediately fixing or changing them.

**Warning sign:** I'm already planning how to distract myself, think it away, or make it stop.

### 4. What is this feeling trying to tell me?

**Good sign:** I can be curious - "What does this sadness need?" "What is this anger protecting?"

**Warning sign:** I judge the feeling as bad, wrong, or something I shouldn't have.

### 5. Can I give this feeling some space?

**Good sign:** I can breathe with it, name it kindly, let it be here for now.

**Warning sign:** I feel like I have to solve it right this second or push it down.

## ðŸŒ± How to Use This

**When you notice strong emotions:** Stop and pick 2-3 questions that feel most important.

**Write it down or just notice silently.**

**Try one small thing:** Take three breaths, put a hand on your heart, or say "It's okay to feel this."

**Remember:** The goal isn't to feel better immediately. It's to be present with what's actually happening inside you.
