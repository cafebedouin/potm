# Staying With Feelings
*A Simple Practice for Everyday Life*

---

## Why This Matters
Feelings are not problems to solve. They are signals from body and mind, telling us something important.  
But many of us have learned to push them aside:

- **Think our way out** (“Why do I feel this way?”)  
- **Distract ourselves** (scrolling, eating, staying busy)  
- **Rush to fix** (“How do I make this stop?”)  

When we pause and stay, feelings can teach us.

## The Simple Practice (20 Minutes)

**What you need:** a quiet space and 20 minutes.

**Step 1: Pause and Settle**  
- Sit comfortably, set a timer.  
- Take three slow breaths, let your body relax.  

**Step 2: Scan Your Body**  
- Start at the top of your head.  
- Move slowly downward, noticing sensations and feelings.  
- Go all the way to your toes.  

**Step 3: Stay With What You Find**  
- When something stands out—tightness, heaviness, buzzing—pause.  
- Give it a simple name: *“sad heaviness,” “buzzy energy,” “tight chest.”*  
- Sit with it for a minute. Don’t change it. Just notice: *“Oh, there you are.”*  

**Step 4: Continue**  
- Move on when you’re ready.  
- Some days there will be lots, some days little. Both are fine.

## Tips
- Use simple words, not analysis.  
- If it feels overwhelming, open your eyes and look around—anchor to the room.  
- Be curious, not harsh. Exploration, not judgment.  
- The goal is **not fixing**—just staying present.  

---

## When to Use
- Daily grounding check-in.  
- When you feel upset or foggy.  
- Before decisions, to see what your body is saying.

## Lineage
This practice draws on:  
- **Eugene Gendlin’s Focusing** (developed as a way to work with the “felt sense”).  
- **Meg-John Barker’s *Staying With Feelings*** (zine on how culture teaches us to avoid emotions, and how to meet them with curiosity instead).  

Both emphasise that feelings are teachers, not enemies.
