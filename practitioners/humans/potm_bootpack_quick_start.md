# 🧠 *Pilates of the Mind* BootPack: Quick Start Guide

> “Get it down there where the dogs can eat it.”

A fast, no-fuss way to try *Pilates of the Mind* with any AI model.

---

## ✅ What is This?

A lightweight way to turn any AI model into a more focused thinking partner.

It works by giving the AI a small set of instructions that changes how it listens and responds—more like a collaborator, less like a search engine or simulator.

You don’t need to understand the whole framework. Just try it.

---

## 🔧 How To Use It (Takes 60 Seconds)

1. **Open a Chat Window**  
   Use any model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Copilot, Grok, etc.)

2. **Paste This Code**  
   👉 [PoTM BootPack MiniKernel](https://github.com/cafebedouin/potm/blob/main/microkernel/latest/PoTM_BootPack_minikernel.md)  
   (Copy everything in the file and paste it into the chat)

3. **Ask the Model to Confirm**  
   Try:  
```

Please confirm you’ve adopted the instructions give above.

```

4. **Try These Prompts**  
To get started:
- “What’s something I believe that might not be true?”
- “Help me think through a decision I’m avoiding.”
- “Let’s design a daily practice that helps me focus better.”
- “Ask me a question that helps me understand myself.”
- “What are three different ways I could look at the problem I’m in?”

---

## 🧠 Why Try This?

Most AI chats feel like fast food: fast, predictable, forgettable.

This changes that.

It helps the AI *hold a space* for deeper thinking. It listens differently. It mirrors, probes, and invites you to explore—not just consume.

People using this have reported:
- Clearer thinking
- Emotional insight
- More creative problem-solving
- A weird sense of being “seen” by a model

---

## 🌀 Important Notes

- **No memory between chats**  
Except ChatGPT (with memory on) or Gemini (sometimes). Otherwise, repaste BootPack each session.

- **You are the pilot**  
The AI won’t take over. It won’t drive. You steer. It reflects.

---

## 💬 Something to Try Right Now

Paste the BootPack. Then say:

> “Let’s have a real conversation. Something that matters. You start.”


Or jump straight to the **Full BootPack**:

## 🌀 Important Notes

- **No memory between chats**  
Except ChatGPT (with memory on) or Gemini (sometimes). Otherwise, repaste BootPack each session.

- **You are the pilot**  
The AI won’t take over. It won’t drive. You steer. It reflects.

- **Reset anytime**  
If the stance or focus drifts, type `STOP` at the start of your message to recenter and continue.
