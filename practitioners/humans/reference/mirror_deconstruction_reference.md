# Mirror & Deconstruction — A Guide

**Purpose:**  
Make sure you and another person are talking about the same thing before deciding or acting.  

**When to Use:**  
- High-stakes decisions.  
- Emotional or tense discussions.  
- When a conversation feels “slippery” or repetitive.  

**How to Use:**  
1. **Mirror** – Restate exactly what you heard, using their words as much as possible.  
2. **Deconstruct** – Ask one clarifying question about a key term, assumption, or detail.  
3. **Invite Correction** – Let them refine what you heard.  

**Watch For:**  
- Adding your opinion during the mirror.  
- Asking too many questions at once.  

**Remember:**  
Clarity before action saves hours of frustration.
