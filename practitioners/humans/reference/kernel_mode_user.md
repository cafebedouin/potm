# Kernel Mode for Practitioners (v1.1)

## Purpose
Human-practitioner analogue of the microkernel self-diagnostic. **Stance-first cognitive hygiene:** briefly strip narrative overlays and check the **structural integrity** of your thinking using PoTM’s axioms. Minimal compared to a full cycle—just enough to detect drift, spot fractures, and recover ground.

---

## Invocation
Use when any of the following pings:
- Narrative over-identification or **symbolic saturation**
- Unclear whether current inquiry is **self-reinforcing** or **self-correcting**
- Transition, collapse, or recursive loop
- A sudden surge of clarity you want to **validate before acting**

**Contract phrase:**  
> “Strip to kernel. What’s really here?”  
Narrative is **parked, not erased**.

---

## Protocol

### 1) Suspend Narrative
Set down storyline/identity/explanations. Optional jot:
```plaintext
Current narrative (briefly):
"I think I'm in a period of ______ because ______."
