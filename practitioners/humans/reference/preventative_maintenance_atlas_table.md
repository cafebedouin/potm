## Meta-Layers

- **Spiral Catcher** → Track recurring issues that surface naturally in journals, conversations, or emotions.  
- **Silent Drift Watch** → Set reminders for domains least likely to resurface on their own (insurance, estate planning, etc.).  

---

## Ethical Alignment

This Atlas Table enacts **Gildor’s Paradox**:  
- Lay out broadly, suggest lightly, never coerce.  
- Authority rests with the practitioner.  
- Practices are transparent, finite, non-final — a lantern, not a leash.
