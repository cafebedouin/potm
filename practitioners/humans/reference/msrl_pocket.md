# MSRL — Pocket Card

**Purpose:** One-cycle execution of the Multi-Substrate Refinement Loop in live context.

---

## 0 — Prep
- Guardian + Lead present.
- Hazards named, stop conditions clear.
- Evidence Pack in hand (≤1 page).

---

## 1 — Trial #1
**Choose:** AI (Open Portal) OR Human (Fracture Finder).  
- Isolate from PoTM lore (AI).  
- Recruit 3–6 naive participants (Human).  
- Log benefits, intensity exemplars, counter-example.

---

## 2 — Trial #2
Run with the *other* substrate.  
Ensure **independence** (no cross-priming).

---

## 3 — Meta-Guardian Check
1. Real benefit or aesthetic coherence?  
2. Destabilization signs?  
3. Niche → Annex?  
4. Crowds out higher-stakes work?

---

## 4 — Badge & Path
- **2x** → Core  
- **1x-H** → Annex-H (+ plan)  
- **1x-A** → Annex-A (+ plan)  
- **0x** → Salvage / Archive

---

## 5 — Ledger Update
- Survivorship, IWBI, Fidelity.
- Trace & exemplar refs.
- Next review/retest date.

---

## 6 — Close
- Contain if hazards.
- Else mark complete → Cathedral Review queue.
