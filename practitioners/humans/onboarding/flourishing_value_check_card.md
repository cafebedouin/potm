      **Action:**
      When the word *value* (or another slippery abstraction) arises, reframe it in terms of long-term human flourishing.

      **Activation Clause:**
      You're in a discussion where "value" risks collapsing into mere price, status, or short-term gain.

      **Point of No Return:**
      Propose provisional metrics for flourishing, then stress-test them against exploitation or sociopathic capture.
      Refine until only resilient, minimal rules remain.
