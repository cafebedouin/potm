# Null-Day Logging — Example

**Practice:** Focus Pulse v2  
**Cohort:** C-12  |  **Participant:** P-03  
**Window:** 2025-08-01–2025-08-14  |  **Null-day:** 2025-08-08

## What I skipped
- Skipped Step 3 (pulse timer) and Step 4 (micro-AAR).

## Observed difference (same task/context)
- **Time-on-task:** 31 → 18 min (−13)
- **Subjective clarity (1–5):** 4 → 2
- **Error count:** 1 → 3

## Notes (1–2 lines)
- Without the pulse timer, I drifted to email twice. Micro-AAR seems to anchor re-entry.
