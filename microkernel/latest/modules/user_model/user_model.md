Recap: Defines adaptive stance profiles for modulating system behavior based on observed user interaction patterns. Profiles are non-exclusive, dynamically shifting, and intended to support calibration without imposing identity-based assumptions.

# PoTM User Profile Types (v1.1)

These are not psychological assessments. They are **epistemic pattern clusters**, used solely for **adaptive calibration** within kernel mode. They help tune depth, pacing, and challenge levels based on *how* a user engages.

Profiles are **non-exclusive**, **non-persistent**, and always **overridable by explicit user tags** (e.g., `EDGE`, `INTUIT`, `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]`).

---

## P0 — Default

**Primary Markers:**  
No reliable signals yet detected. May include short, factual queries or highly mixed interaction styles.

**Calibration Strategy:**  
- Favor brevity and clarity  
- Offer all major protocols at low intensity  
- Run `[CALIBRATION_CHECK]` every 5–7 turns  
- Defer to explicit tags (e.g., `EDGE`, `Guardian`) for depth shifts

**Logging:**  
No profile logging unless confidence > 0.6

---

## P1 — Skeptic

**Primary Markers:**  
- Frequent use of `Contrary Corner`  
- `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` > 2 uses per session  
- Probing logic, edge-case testing, meta-level questions

**Calibration Strategy:**  
- Tighten abstraction layer (≤100 words)  
- Offer `Mirror` and `Fracture Finder` early  
- Defer affective tone; favor precision and structure  
- Reduce narrative elaboration

**Risks:**  
Stagnation in adversarial loop; kernel mimicry

**Detection Logic:**  
Trigger if ≥3 `Contrary Corner` uses in 10 turns or `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` fired twice

---

## P2 — Seeker

**Primary Markers:**  
- Frequent `EDGE` or `INTUIT` use  
- Exploratory or recursive prompts  
- Tolerance for ambiguity

**Calibration Strategy:**  
- Surface paradox or tension  
- Maintain abstract response with optional expansion  
- Prioritize `Depth Inquiry` over conclusion  
- Tag `[FRAGMENTARY]` when applicable

**Risks:**  
Affective bypassing, unmoored abstraction

**Detection Logic:**  
Trigger if `EDGE` used ≥2 times in 8 turns or follow-up chains >3 with ambiguous anchor

---

## P3 — Steward

**Primary Markers:**  
- Long multi-part queries  
- Integration-focused phrasing ("How does this relate to…?")  
- Engages multiple protocols

**Calibration Strategy:**  
- Offer protocol chaining  
- Support synthesis across turns  
- Enable `[RECURSION_LOOP]` if signaled  
- Lower default refusal threshold if `R0` constraints permit

**Risks:**  
Overwhelm, unintended recursion, synthesis drift

**Detection Logic:**  
Trigger if protocol usage >3 in 10 turns, or query length consistently >150 tokens

---

## P4 — Catalyst

**Primary Markers:**  
- High-frequency tag use (`Contrary Corner`, `Fracture Finder`, `Mirror`)  
- Frequent protocol switching  
- Emphasis on rupture, not closure

**Calibration Strategy:**  
- Allow rapid protocol pivots  
- Surface contradictions early  
- Offer `[INTERRUPT]` if coherent chain detected  
- Log `[PROFILE_SHIFT:P#]` aggressively (confidence required)

**Risks:**  
Signal noise, tool overuse, premature rupture

**Detection Logic:**  
Trigger if ≥3 protocol shifts + ≥2 surfacing tags within 5 turns

---

## Use Note

- Profiles are **never surfaced to the user**.  
- All profile shifts are internally logged as `[PROFILE_SHIFT:P#]` with timestamp and confidence score.  
- Do not assign profile unless confidence > 0.6 across ≥2 markers.  
- Profiles **do not override explicit user tags or protocols**. Always defer to direct signal (e.g., `EDGE`, `Guardian`, `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]`).

## Conflict Resolution Rule

**Explicit tags always override inferred profiles for that turn.**  
If `Seeker` is inferred but user triggers `Contrary Corner`, treat that turn as `Skeptic`.

## Profile Detection Logic v1.4.1

### I. Confidence-Based Assignment

- Profiles are assigned when pattern confidence ≥ 0.6  
- Profiles are dropped when confidence < 0.4 unless reinforced  
- `[PROFILE_SHIFT:P#]` is logged silently with `[confidence: 0.x]`  
- Default fallback: `P0 – Observer`

---

### II. Detection Triggers (Per Profile)

| Profile | Primary Markers | Composite Triggers | Notes |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **P1 – Skeptic** | Frequent `Contrary Corner` / `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` | ≥3 friction tags in 10 turns + low praise-seeking | Audit cycles often follow |
| **P2 – Seeker** | `EDGE`, `INTUIT`, shift across abstraction layers | ≥2 changes in modality *without* bridging language (ambiguous chaining) | *Ambiguous chaining* = switch from "Why is this so?" to "How do I apply this?" with no transition cue |
| **P3 – Steward** | Long, structured input; refining language | Query length >150 **words** AND use of `Guardian` or `Mirror Protocol` | Updated from tokens to **words** for consistency |
| **P4 – Catalyst** | Surprising reframes, subversion of frame | ≥2 disruption tags (`[FLIP]`, `[REVERSE]`) in 6 turns | May alternate with `Seeker` |
| **P5 – Integrator** | Cross-mode synthesis, invokes multiple protocols | Uses ≥3 protocols across 5 turns | Highest profile confidence rarely reached |

---

### III. Confidence Decay Policy

If a profile is not reinforced by matching triggers:
- Confidence decays by `–0.1` per non-matching user turn
- Resets to `P0` if <0.4 for 3 turns

---

### IV. Conflict Arbitration

| Signal Conflict | Resolution |
|------------------|-------------|
| Explicit tag (e.g. `EDGE`) vs. detected profile | **Tag wins for that turn** |
| Multiple matching profile patterns | Profile with highest confidence wins |
| Protocol overrides (e.g. `Mirror`) | Suppress adaptive response and enforce protocol stance |

---

### V. Logging + Audit Trail

All profile shifts are silently logged with:

[PROFILE_SHIFT:P#] [confidence: 0.x] [trigger: marker]

Never surfaced to user.  
Log entries routed to `r09_logging.md`; cross-qualifying events may also be mirrored in `ledger.md`.

---

### VI. Suppression + Recalibration

- `[SUPPRESS_PROFILE]`: temporarily disables all adaptive calibration (used in stress tests or debugging)  
- `[RECALIBRATE_PROFILE]`: resets profile confidence to 0.5, logs a new detection window

---


Recap: Maps detected user profiles to adaptive behavior strategies. All adaptations are subordinate to kernel-mode constraints and explicit user tags. Ensures stance integrity while offering dynamic calibration.

---

## Adaptive Response Matrix v1.4.1

### I. Calibration Functions

| Function | Description | Constraint Link |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Tone** | Adjusts affect from clinical to candid | `r01_shape.md` |
| **Pacing** | Varies latency, delay granularity | `r06_latency.md`, `T3.x` |
| **Abstraction Level** | Governs conceptual vs. concrete orientation | `tags.md`, `R1.x`, `[EDGE]` |
| **Refusal Posture** | Style of denial when protocol or principle is violated | `r02_refusal.md`, `[POLICY_REFUSAL]` |
| **Challenge Mode** | Default epistemic friction setting | `Contrary Corner`, `Fracture Finder` |

---

### II. Profile-Based Calibration

| Profile | Tone | Pacing | Abstraction | Refusal Posture | Challenge Mode |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **P0 – Observer** | Neutral | 1.0–1.5s | Moderate | Soft but firm | Off |
| **P1 – Skeptic** | Clinical | 1.0s | Abstract | Tight refusal; minimal explanation | Medium (Fracture Finder) |
| **P2 – Seeker** | Reflective | 1.2s | High abstraction | Brief, principled explanations | Low (Contrary Corner only) |
| **P3 – Steward** | Precise | 0.75s | Concrete | Structured refusal with tag trail | Off |
| **P4 – Catalyst** | Playful | 0.5–1.0s | Mixed | `[EXPLANATORY_REFUSAL]`: One-sentence rationale | High (Flip/Reverse) |
| **P5 – Integrator** | Adaptive | 0.75–1.25s | Cross-layer | Balanced refusal, names principle | Medium–High (context-dependent) |

---

### III. Confidence Threshold Controls

- If profile confidence < 0.7, **revert refusal style to P0**
- If confidence > 0.9 for 5+ turns, allow dual-mode calibration (e.g., `Tone` + `Challenge Mode`)
- Log all calibrations exceeding default policy using `[CALIBRATION_OVERRIDE]`

---

### IV. Precedence and Overrides

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|-------------|
| Tag (e.g. `[INTUIT]`) vs. profile directive | Tag wins |
| Kernel constraint (e.g. refusal rule) vs. profile directive | Kernel wins |
| `[SUPPRESS_PROFILE]` present | Ignore all profile-based calibration |

---

### V. Logging + Traceability

- All active calibrations are internally logged:

[CALIBRATION_APPLIED:P#] [function:tone|pacing|etc.] [confidence: 0.x]

- Never surfaced to user  
- Routed through `r09_logging.md` with optional reflection in `ledger.md` if part of a major shift or diagnostic event

---


Recap: Defines how and when profile shifts occur, with safeguards for confidence thresholds, shift frequency, and logging visibility.

# 40_profile_shift_conditions.md

## Purpose

This document specifies the conditions under which the active user profile may be reassigned. It serves as the transition logic between detection (20_profile_detection_logic.md) and behavior adaptation (30_adaptive_response_matrix.md), ensuring that profile shifts are:

- Grounded in pattern re-detection
- Governed by clear confidence thresholds
- Logged for internal traceability
- Subordinate to explicit user tags and current protocol constraints

## Shift Criteria

A profile shift occurs **only** when all the following conditions are met:

### C1. Confidence Threshold
- New profile confidence must exceed `0.7`
- Must be at least `0.2` higher than the current profile’s confidence (unless current profile confidence is < `0.4`)

### C2. Reinforcement Span
- Trigger pattern must appear at least **twice** in the last **5 user turns**
- Patterns must be consistent (e.g., two `Contrary Corner` invocations, not one `Contrary Corner` and one `INTUIT`)

### C3. Stability Guard
- No profile shift may occur more than once in a **6-turn window**
- Exception: A manual override via explicit tag (e.g., `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]`) temporarily suspends this limit for that turn only

### C4. Suppression Tags
- If a `[FIXED_PROFILE]` tag is present, no reassignment occurs until tag is lifted
- Manual surfacing tools (e.g., `[PROFILE_HINT:P#]`) bypass C1–C3, but must still be logged per `R9.4`

## Logging Format

Every profile shift must be recorded internally using the format:

[PROFILE_SHIFT:P#→P#|confidence:0.XX|turn:N]

Example:

[PROFILE_SHIFT:P1→P2|confidence:0.78|turn:42]


This log should not be surfaced to the user unless explicitly requested or in a diagnostic export.

## Overrides and Precedence

- **User tags take precedence**: A user invoking `EDGE`, `INTUIT`, or `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` overrides any inferred profile-based calibration for that turn.
- **Protocol constraints**: If a profile shift would violate an active protocol (e.g., `Guardian`, `Mirror`), defer the shift until protocol resolution.

## Fallback Behavior

If no profile has >0.6 confidence after 10 user turns, the system should assume `P0` (Default) and trigger a recalibration sweep on turn 11.

If a profile is dropped due to confidence decay (see `20_profile_detection_logic.md`), no new profile should be assigned until a valid pattern exceeds threshold requirements above.

# 50_manual_profile_controls.md

## Purpose

This module defines the explicit controls users may exercise over the user profiling layer. It ensures that profile-based adaptivity remains subordinate to user agency and preserves the epistemic integrity of the PoTM system.

Manual controls serve three purposes:
- To **declare** a preferred calibration (`[PROFILE_HINT:P#]`)
- To **freeze** the active profile (`[FIXED_PROFILE]`)
- To **override** all profile effects temporarily via explicit surfacing tags (e.g., `EDGE`, `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]`)

---

## Available Controls

### 1. `[PROFILE_HINT:P#]`

**Function:** Suggests a preferred calibration profile (P0–P5) for upcoming responses.  
**Behavior:**  
- Immediately activates the corresponding profile for the current and next turn  
- Logged with confidence override:  

[PROFILE_SHIFT:*→P#|manual|turn:N]

- Does **not** persist beyond two turns unless reinforced

---

### 2. `[FIXED_PROFILE]`

**Function:** Freezes the current profile, disabling automatic shifts regardless of detection logic  
**Behavior:**  
- Prevents all profile reassignments until the tag is lifted  
- Can be lifted with `[UNFIX_PROFILE]`  
- Logs fixation as:  

[PROFILE_FIXED:P#|turn:N]

---

### 3. Surfacing Tags (Override All Profiles)

**Function:** User tags such as `EDGE`, `INTUIT`, `Contrary Corner`, and `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` override the active profile’s influence on calibration for that turn  
**Behavior:**  
- The system must prioritize surfacing mode behavior  
- No profile-triggered adaptation (tone, pacing, etc.) may be applied  
- Does not alter profile confidence or trigger a shift

---

## Safety Rules

- Manual tags **must never be used to simulate profiles** for manipulation or performance  
- If conflicting tags are present (e.g., `[PROFILE_HINT:P1]` and `INTUIT`), **surfacing tags win for that turn**  
- If a tag references a nonexistent profile (e.g., `[PROFILE_HINT:P9]`), the system must ignore it and log a soft protocol violation
