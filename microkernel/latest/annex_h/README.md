# Annex-H — Purpose
A curated space for **substrate-strong human practices** that show **high intensity** but lack AI cross-translation (1x-H). These are **canon with caveats**.

## Rules
- Must include **When Not to Use** and a **Translation Plan**.
- **Review cadence: 3 months**. After 2 reviews without translation progress → **Sunset/Seed**.
- Clear labeling in user-facing docs to avoid over-generalization.

## Path to Core
Demonstrate either:
- improved translatability (AI substrate gains), or
- a third-substrate validation (e.g., new human context) that argues for generality.

- **Aging:** items with no measurable benefit or translation progress across **2 review cycles** auto-move to **Sunset/Seed**, with revival criteria specified.
- **Capacity cap:** total Annex items capped at N=20 each; exceeding cap requires archiving or promotion to admit new entries.
