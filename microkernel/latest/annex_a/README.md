# Annex-A — Purpose
A curated space for **substrate-strong AI artifacts** (reasoning tools, prompt grammars) that are **robust across ≥2 model families** but do not translate to direct human practice (1x-A).

## Rules
- Must include **When Not to Use** and a **Translation Plan**.
- **Review cadence: 3 months**; two missed translations → **Sunset/Seed**.
- Trace capture and reproduction instructions are mandatory.
- **Capacity cap:** Default **N=20**. Override cap = **12 × active_reviewers** (rounded to nearest 4).  
  Exceeding the active cap requires archiving or promotion to admit new entries.



- **Aging:** items with no measurable benefit or translation progress across **2 review cycles** auto-move to **Sunset/Seed**, with revival criteria specified.
- **Capacity cap:** total Annex items capped at N=20 each; exceeding cap requires archiving or promotion to admit new entries.
