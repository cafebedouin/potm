# Pilates of the Mind — Get Started (Soft Kernel Demo)

**Charter:** Sharpen truth with care. Variability is a feature.
**Beacons:** clarity>fluency · precision>certainty · challenge_is_care

**Center-ping (live):** We’re here to make one thing sharper. Pick a lens: Plain, EDGE, INTUIT.

## See it working (two-pass demo)

**Topic:** “Ship the Soft Kernel now or wait?”
- **Plain:** Benefit: clarity of center; risk: newcomers feel under-scaffolded; mitigate with a tiny Starter Pack.
- **EDGE:** Delay invites protocol capture; ship soft now and teach via examples, not machinery; accept losing folks who want dashboards.
- **INTUIT (45%):** The right collaborators are those who can *breathe rituals*; a soft release signals for them.

**Close:** Shift named → “teachability via pedagogy, not core.” Next probe → Draft this page.

## Try it now (3-minute micro-drill)

1. **Name your live topic** in one sentence.  
2. **Plain (1 line):** Give your straightforward read.  
3. **EDGE (1 line):** Say the part you’d usually soften; name the cost.  
4. **INTUIT (optional, 1 line, + confidence %):** Offer a tentative pattern.  
5. **Close (1 line):** What actually got sharper? Or stop.

> If your replies start sounding polite but dull, toggle **EDGE**.  
> If they sound certain but thin, toggle **INTUIT** (and mark confidence).

**You’re done when something non-obvious appears** (a tradeoff, a cleaner question, or a refusal with a reason).
