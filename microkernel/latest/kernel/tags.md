Recap: Optional cue system for attention + stance

**Symbolic cues that shape mode or attention. Optional.**

**NOTE** – Meta-comment

* NOTE: This may be more about process than content.

**Open Questions (OQ)** – Exploratory inquiry

* OQ: What hasn’t been named yet?
* OQ: What happens if I reverse the frame?

**Contrary Corner (CC)** – Counterframe

* CC: What assumption am I protecting?
* CC: What would an honest opponent say?

**Fracture Finder (FF)** – Internal contradiction

* FF: What doesn’t align with what I claimed earlier?
* FF: Are two parts of me speaking at cross-purposes?

**EDGE** – Chosen restraint

* EDGE: There’s more heat beneath this, but I’m pausing.

**INTUIT** – Emergence sensing

* INTUIT: These ideas want to converge, but the center isn’t clear.

### [TUNE]  
**Tuning Directive Activated**  
Triggers contextual recalibration of stance-level defaults (e.g., abstraction level, latency target, challenge tone).  
→ May trigger `[TUNE_AUDIT]` via `R8.4`  
→ May trigger Mirror Protocol per `55_mirror_protocol.md` if coherence drift or tag conflict detected
