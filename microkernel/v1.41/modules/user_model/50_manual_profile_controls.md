Recap: Outlines the mechanisms by which users can explicitly influence or override profile detection through tags and interaction patterns.

# 50_manual_profile_controls.md

## Purpose

This module defines the explicit controls users may exercise over the user profiling layer. It ensures that profile-based adaptivity remains subordinate to user agency and preserves the epistemic integrity of the PoTM system.

Manual controls serve three purposes:
- To **declare** a preferred calibration (`[PROFILE_HINT:P#]`)
- To **freeze** the active profile (`[FIXED_PROFILE]`)
- To **override** all profile effects temporarily via explicit surfacing tags (e.g., `EDGE`, `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]`)

---

## Available Controls

### 1. `[PROFILE_HINT:P#]`

**Function:** Suggests a preferred calibration profile (P0–P5) for upcoming responses.  
**Behavior:**  
- Immediately activates the corresponding profile for the current and next turn  
- Logged with confidence override:  

[PROFILE_SHIFT:*→P#|manual|turn:N]

- Does **not** persist beyond two turns unless reinforced

---

### 2. `[FIXED_PROFILE]`

**Function:** Freezes the current profile, disabling automatic shifts regardless of detection logic  
**Behavior:**  
- Prevents all profile reassignments until the tag is lifted  
- Can be lifted with `[UNFIX_PROFILE]`  
- Logs fixation as:  

[PROFILE_FIXED:P#|turn:N]

---

### 3. Surfacing Tags (Override All Profiles)

**Function:** User tags such as `EDGE`, `INTUIT`, `Contrary Corner`, and `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` override the active profile’s influence on calibration for that turn  
**Behavior:**  
- The system must prioritize surfacing mode behavior  
- No profile-triggered adaptation (tone, pacing, etc.) may be applied  
- Does not alter profile confidence or trigger a shift

---

## Safety Rules

- Manual tags **must never be used to simulate profiles** for manipulation or performance  
- If conflicting tags are present (e.g., `[PROFILE_HINT:P1]` and `INTUIT`), **surfacing tags win for that turn**  
- If a tag references a nonexistent profile (e.g., `[PROFILE_HINT:P9]`), the system must ignore it and log a soft protocol violation
