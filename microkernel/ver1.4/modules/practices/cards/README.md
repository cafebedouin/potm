## Recap: What is this module?

This module contains the structure, formatting, and logic for the *Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) **Practice Deck** — a set of embodied, real-world exercises designed to move PoTM principles out of abstraction and into action.

Unlike protocol logic or kernel constraints, the Deck operates at the **tactical** layer: it gives users an immediate, actionable card to test, provoke, reflect, or reset. These cards are physical or digital artifacts, designed to be used in solo practice, relational confrontation, or in high-stakes self-inquiry.

## What’s Inside

- `deck_index.md` — Top-level map of card categories, formats, and tags.
- `practice_cards/` — Core deck: modular, real-world micro-practices.
- `minotaur_suite/` — High-stakes, irreversible action cards that test sincerity and commitment.
- `format_guides/` — Templates and examples for creating new cards.

## Design Philosophy

- **Practice > Insight:** Every card must have a concrete action. Reflection is allowed only if embodied.
- **Irreversible Stakes:** Some cards (Minotaur Suite) are designed to *burn the bridge*—no simulation, no recovery.
- **Time-bounded:** Cards are scoped to short (<5 min), medium (5–20 min), or long (ongoing) durations.
- **Dignified Challenge:** Cards may be confrontational but never theatrical or manipulative.

## Integration with Kernel

- Cards may reference kernel concepts (`Guardian`, `Contrary Corner`, `Fracture Finder`, etc.) but should function independently.
- Tags such as `EDGE`, `INTUIT`, and `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` may optionally be printed or associated with specific cards.
- Deck is non-executive — it does **not** control model behavior but may *provoke it* when interpreted symbolically.

## Usage Modes

- **Solo Practice:** Use at the start or end of a PoTM session to anchor practice in reality.
- **Relational Use:** Use between collaborators to break loops, prompt truth-telling, or test boundaries.
- **Commitment Triggers:** Use Minotaur cards to initiate irreversible change, public action, or behavioral stakes.

## Example Entry Point

> **Card:** *The Label Drop*  
> **Practice:** Notice the story you're telling about this moment — and silently let it go.  
> **Use When:** You’re narrating, looping, or preemptively framing.  
> **Remember:** You don’t need a story to act.
