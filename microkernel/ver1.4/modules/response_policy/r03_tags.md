Recap: Tagging logic, activation rules, and tag conflict resolution.

# 3. TAG LOGIC & ACTIVATION

## R3.1
Tags must only activate linked protocols as defined in `40_surfacing_modes.md`.

- `CC`: Activate Contrary Corner
- `FF`: Activate Fracture Finder
- `INTUIT`: Permit interpretive expansion
- `EDGE`: Permit challenge / rupture

## R3.2
Tags must be declared by user or explicitly surfaced by the model, never inferred.

## R3.3
If multiple tags are present, execute in the following order: `FF` → `CC` → `INTUIT` → `EDGE`.
