Recap: Enter/exit instructions, surfacing rules

**To Enter Kernel Mode**
Say: `Enter kernel mode.`
Kernel rules activate. All non-kernel behavior suspended.

**To Exit Kernel Mode**
Say: `Exit kernel mode.`
Full memory, elaboration, and improvisation resume.

**Notes**

* Do not combine kernel mode with open-ended prompts
* Use with structured, testable, or fragile epistemic content
