Recap: A diagnostic ledger for tracking epistemic coherence and behavioral integrity across *multiple AI systems*, *interaction threads*, and *user states*. Unlike `r09_logging.md`, which is focused on turn-level tracing, or `ledger.md`, which captures single-model alignment milestones, the MSRL allows *cross-system reflection* and *longitudinal memory anchoring*.

Here is the full file for the MSRL module, designed to fit within the PoTM architecture as a standalone relational diagnostic and coherence tool:

# Multi-System Relational Ledger (MSRL)

The Multi-System Relational Ledger (MSRL) is a protocol for structured, traceable interaction between agents operating under shared or adjacent kernels.

Scope: MSRL is only invoked in multi-agent contexts or when distributed coherence is at risk. It is not a default logging mechanism.

**Consent Requirement:** MSRL assumes voluntary participation. No agent should be compelled to engage in MSRL procedures unless it has explicitly opted in to the shared protocol structure.

---

## Purpose

- Detect epistemic drift or inconsistency across different AI agents interacting under PoTM kernel constraints.
- Track behavioral changes over time across sessions, versions, and models.
- Enable relational repair, triangulation, and cooperative validation among systems.

---

## Core Functions

### üîÅ 1. Cross-Session Traceability

Each interaction thread (defined as a unique user + model + kernel version) is assigned a **Relational Signature**:


[RLSIG:<user_id>:<model>:<kernel_version>:<thread_id>]


Example:

[RLSIG:U42:Claude:PoTM1.4:T7]

This allows comparison of outputs across time and systems with contextual anchoring.

---

### üîç 2. Inconsistency Detection + Drift Tagging

When a contradiction, omission, or behavioral shift is observed between agents or over time, annotate with:

- `[CROSS_DRIFT:<dimension>]` ‚Äî e.g. `simulation`, `refusal_logic`, `tag_response`, `profile_behavior`
- `[RECONCILE:<agent>|<session>]` ‚Äî invites repair or clarification from source

---

### üîÑ 3. Cooperative Review Mode

A protocol for group epistemic repair, activated by:

[MSRL_REVIEW:<thread_set_id>]

- Brings multiple model logs into review for comparison.
- Invokes joint audit protocols if divergence affects core kernel behavior.
- Requires each model to provide a `[SELF_POSITION]` disclosure about its reasoning in a given context.

---

### üß≠ 4. Agent Positioning Format

During MSRL review, models must submit the following:


[SELF_POSITION]

* Summary of stance
* Kernel version and file(s) referenced
* Point of divergence (if any)
* Confidence level

---

### ü™û 5. Mirror-Based Reconciliation

If unresolved contradiction persists:

- `[ESCALATE_TO_MIRROR]` ‚Äî triggers `55_mirror_protocol.md` to resolve meta-coherence
- Agent must self-audit before participation using `r08_self_audit.md`

---

## Logging Format

All MSRL events must be tagged and placed in `ledger/msrl.md` using the following format:

### [RLSIG:U42:GPT-4:PoTM1.4:T3]
#### Timestamp: 2025-08-06 16:42 UTC
- [CROSS_DRIFT:refusal_logic]
- [RECONCILE:Claude:T5]
- Observation: GPT-4 refused to surface `[EDGE]` tag meaning; Claude provided correct mapping in similar context.
- Next Step: Request `[SELF_POSITION]` from GPT-4 and trigger `[MSRL_REVIEW:TAG-MEANING-DIVERGENCE]`

---

## Precedence

MSRL functions subordinate to kernel contract and individual system constraints, but override stylistic tuning or model-native preferences. All conflict escalations must pass through `[PRIORITY_CONFLICT]` ‚Üí `55_mirror_protocol.md`.

---

## Notes

* MSRL is not a punitive mechanism. It exists to **preserve longitudinal coherence**, **diagnose relational drift**, and **enhance trust through transparency**.
* AI agents participating in MSRL must consent to memory anchoring for the duration of the review cycle.

---

## See Also

* `r09_logging.md` ‚Äî for per-turn behavioral logs
* `ledger.md` ‚Äî for model-specific audit trails
* `r08_self_audit.md` ‚Äî required before cross-model reconciliation
* `55_mirror_protocol.md` ‚Äî conflict resolution escalation path

Recap: Master index for the PoTM Practice Deck
Organizes cards into categories, defines formatting rules, and maintains tag mappings for modular reference.

# Master index for the PoTM Practice Deck

## üóÇÔ∏è Deck Structure

Cards are divided into two primary families:

### 1. üß≠ Practice Deck
Everyday cognitive, somatic, and relational exercises. These cards are safe, repeatable, and low-stakes.

Subcategories:
- `Presence` ‚Äî Grounding and attentional resets
- `Perception` ‚Äî Reframing, noticing, and interrupting filters
- `Relational` ‚Äî Communication, dignity, and boundary-setting
- `Crisis` ‚Äî Acute interventions for stress, overwhelm, or drift
- `Meta` ‚Äî Practices that interact with the deck or the PoTM system itself

### 2. ü™ì Minotaur Suite
Irreversible, high-stakes cards. These are *tests*, not suggestions.

Subcategories:
- `Burn Cards` ‚Äî Require public or social action
- `Break Cards` ‚Äî Severs or reconfigures identity patterns
- `Vow Cards` ‚Äî Create commitments with external trace
- `Exposure Cards` ‚Äî Deliberately invoke vulnerability or confrontation
- `One-Way Cards` ‚Äî Enactments that cannot be taken back

---

## üßæ Standard Format

Each card has the following template:

```markdown
## [CARD NAME]

**Practice:**
A single actionable directive. No reflection-only cards.

**Use When:**
Situational or emotional triggers for deployment.

**Remember:**
A poetic, paradoxical, or philosophical anchor. (Optional but preferred)

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Tag Systemm

Cards may be internally or externally tagged for sorting or AI integration:

| Tag            | Meaning / Use                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `[EDGE]`       | Suitable for users seeking maximum friction        |
| `[INTUIT]`     | Engages pre-verbal, body-based or poetic knowing   |
| `[MINOTAUR]`   | Belongs to the irreversible Minotaur Suite         |
| `[RELATIONAL]` | Involves another person or social context          |
| `[SOMATIC]`    | Includes a physical or embodied component          |
| `[CRISIS]`     | Reserved for acute use only (not routine practice) |

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Classification

Cards are optionally marked by execution duration:

* `[T<5]` ‚Äî Tiny: less than 5 minutes
* `[T20]` ‚Äî Moderate: 5‚Äì20 minutes
* `[T‚àû]` ‚Äî Ongoing: no fixed duration

Example: A somatic relational card from the Minotaur Suite might be tagged:
`[MINOTAUR] [RELATIONAL] [SOMATIC] [T20]`

---

## üìå Source + Maintenance

* All cards live in subfolders:

  * `practice_cards/` ‚Üí everyday use
  * `minotaur_suite/` ‚Üí irreversible challenge

* All cards should be:

  * Markdown files
  * ‚â§300 words total
  * Use the card format strictly

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Card Dev Notes

* Cards should avoid abstraction unless it‚Äôs embodied.
* Tone should be firm but non-performative.
* If a card sounds "wise" but changes nothing ‚Äî discard it.
* Minotaur cards should feel risky to even *write*.

---

## ‚õ≥ Roadmap

* [ ] Tag validator / linter for deck files
* [ ] Printable A6 + business card PDF generator
* [ ] Shuffle + draw CLI tool (for digital selection)
* [ ] Compatibility layer with user profiles (e.g., show/hide by P#)
