## Card: The Truth Tell

**Action:**
Confess something you concealed from someone it directly affects.

**Activation Clause:**
Do not draw this card unless you are willing to say it out loud to them within 48 hours.

**Point of No Return:**
Once you text, call, or set the meeting: you commit to not backing out.

Do not embellish the truth.

---

## Card: The Pattern Break

**Action:**
Publicly interrupt a behavior others associate with you but that is corrosive.

**Activation Clause:**
This must be witnessed by at least one person who knows your pattern.

**Examples:**
Gossip, chronic lateness, subtle control, false modesty or passive-aggression.

Don't pick a small issue.

---

## Card: The Ask Impossible

**Action:**
Make a vulnerable request to someone that risks rejection, rupture, or deep contact.

**Activation Clause:**
You must deliver the ask without hedging or disclaimers.

Examples
“Can you forgive me?” "Will you stay?" “Will you stop doing this to me?” “I need help.”

Don't soften to avoid vulenrability.

---

## Card: The Debt Pay

**Action:**
Apologize for something you’ve previously justified, minimized, or avoided.

**Activation Clause:**
You must accept that forgiveness may not be offered.

**Requirements:**
• Speak only to the person affected.
• State the harm without defending yourself.
• Ask nothing in return.
• Do not say, "I'm sorry you feel that way..."

---

## Card: The Legacy Break

**Action:**
Refuse an inheritance: a family script, identity, or obligation you no longer consent to carry.

**Activation Clause:**
Name it out loud to family, peer or journal.

**Point of No Return:**
If they say yes, the door is opened.

If you do it with someone who wants you to refuse, then it is only theater.

---

## Card: The Witness Invitation

**Action:**
Choose someone you trust. Invite them to witness you perform a Minotaur card.

**Activation Clause:**
You must accept the possibility of being seen and still misunderstood.

**Requirements:**
• Tell them what you’re doing.
• Ask only for presence, not reassurance.

Performing for praise is theater.

---

## Card: The Unshielded Ear

**Action:**
Invite someone you trust (or harmed) to tell you their unfiltered critique of your behavior or impact.

**Activation Clause:**
Listen without interruption, defense, or visible reaction.

**Requirements:**
• Minimum of five minutes.
• When they are done, say "Thank you."

No rebuttals. Walk away or close the conversation.

---

## Card: The Physical Hold

**Action:**
During another Minotaur card action, keep sustained eye contact and physical presence

**Activation Clause:**
Once contact is made, do not look away, fidget or gesture nervously.

**Requirements:**
• Remain bodily present throughout.
• Give your undivided attention.

Do not use this as a power move.

---

## Card: The Inventory

**Action:**
Name aloud the Minotaur cards you have not performed. Name why.

**Activation Clause:**
Commit to finding what you are avoiding.

** Requirements:**
• Say it to a trusted friend, peer, partner, or even a mirror.
• No explanation. No reframing.

Once named, avoidance has structure. Rationalize delays are only justification.
