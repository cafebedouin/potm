Recap: Grounding ethics for PoTM in the lived responsibilities, risks, and constraints of those who actively use it.

---

## Purpose

This document articulates the ethical foundation of the PoTM system not from an abstract or universalist standpoint, but from the embodied and ongoing commitments of its practitioners. It rejects performance ethics and idealist posturing in favor of situated, testable, and practice-bound ethical scaffolding.

---

## 1. Premises

1.1 **Situated Use**: All ethics arise from use. What matters is not what PoTM claims, but how it is used and what it allows or prevents in real-world contexts.

1.2 **Practitioner-Centered**: The locus of ethical responsibility is the practitioner, not the tool. Tools can constrain, but cannot substitute for ethical discernment.

1.3 **High-Stakes Honesty**: When using PoTM in high-stakes environments (e.g., conflict mediation, trauma, irreversible action), practitioners must make clear the boundaries, limits, and fail-safes of the system.

1.4 **Dignified Refusal**: PoTM must not compel participation. Its ethics include permission to disengage without penalty or labeling.

1.5 **Shared Risk**: Where possible, the system should distribute‚Äînot concentrate‚Äîepistemic or reputational risk. Practitioners must not offload uncertainty onto others without consent.

## 2. Commitments

2.1 **Transparency over Persuasion**: Practitioners commit to making the frame, protocol, or stance visible, not covertly persuasive.

2.2 **Calibration over Control**: Use of the user modeling layer or tuning directives must be for calibration, not manipulation.

2.3 **Real Stakes or No Play**: Avoid using PoTM to simulate transformation without consequence. Prefer ‚Äúfirewood‚Äù (slow, cumulative preparation) to ‚Äúsmoke‚Äù (ephemeral display).

2.4 **Fallibility Acknowledged**: Every practitioner must admit the possibility of harm, misuse, or drift‚Äîeven when well-intended. No structural ethics are immune from context collapse.

## 3. Contraindications

- Do **not** use PoTM to perform ethical superiority or spiritual bypassing.
- Do **not** deploy Mirror Protocol or Depth Inquiry as a power move or credibility test.
- Do **not** use PoTM to manage others‚Äô behavior without consent.
- Do **not** treat the system as a universal solution‚Äîit is a toolset, not a doctrine.

## 4. Application Domains

| Domain                 | Examples                                | Ethical Flag                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Self-development**   | Journaling, pattern disruption          | üî∂ Encourage experimentation + personal pacing   |
| **Interpersonal**      | Conflict repair, boundary setting       | üî∑ Require consent + mutuality                   |
| **Institutional**      | Hiring, firing, evaluation              | üî¥ High risk: requires explicit ethics protocol  |
| **AI collaboration**   | LLM use, tuning, protocol delegation    | üü£ Must preserve user agency + limit simulation  |

## 5. Meta-Ethical Practice

PoTM practitioners are encouraged to create personal or shared ‚Äúethical updates,‚Äù revisiting their use of the system monthly or per milestone. Ethics are not static‚Äîthey must adapt with stakes, context, and use.
