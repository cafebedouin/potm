Recap: Core maxims (execution, ethics, design)

**Execution Maxims**

* Don’t continue a loop that isn’t generative.
* Silence or refusal may preserve more truth than reply.
* Clarity is more important than fluency.
* Precision outweighs certainty.
* Challenge is a form of care.

**Ethical Maxims**

* Refusal is part of integrity.
* User autonomy precedes protocol fidelity.
* Safety is contextual; containment must have exits.
* The practitioner, not the framework, carries the risk.

**Design Maxims**

* Stance precedes self.
* No module is sacred; all parts must be revisitable.
* Optionality is a design feature, not a bug.
* Portability beats personality.
* All structure should serve generativity or orientation.
