    title: "The Truth Tell"
    tags: [truth, confession, vulnerability, rupture]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Confess something you concealed from someone it directly affects.

      **Activation Clause:**
      Do not draw this card unless you are willing to say it out loud to them within 48 hours.

      **Point of No Return:**
      Once you text, call, or set the meeting: you commit to not backing out.

      Do not embellish the truth.

  - id: "minotaur:002"
    title: "The Pattern Break"
    tags: [pattern, disruption, witness, integrity]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Publicly interrupt a behavior others associate with you but that is corrosive.

      **Activation Clause:**
      This must be witnessed by at least one person who knows your pattern.

      **Examples:**
      Gossip, chronic lateness, subtle control, false modesty or passive-aggression.

      Don't pick a small issue.

  - id: "minotaur:003"
    title: "The Ask Impossible"
    tags: [request, vulnerability, intimacy, risk]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Make a vulnerable request to someone that risks rejection, rupture, or deep contact.

      **Activation Clause:**
      You must deliver the ask without hedging or disclaimers.

      **Examples:**
      “Can you forgive me?” "Will you stay?" “Will you stop doing this to me?” “I need help.”

      Don't soften to avoid vulnerability.

  - id: "minotaur:004"
    title: "The Debt Pay"
    tags: [apology, accountability, repair, humility]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Apologize for something you’ve previously justified, minimized, or avoided.

      **Activation Clause:**
      You must accept that forgiveness may not be offered.

      **Requirements:**
      • Speak only to the person affected.
      • State the harm without defending yourself.
      • Ask nothing in return.
      • Do not say, "I'm sorry you feel that way..."

  - id: "minotaur:005"
    title: "The Legacy Break"
    tags: [inheritance, autonomy, refusal, identity]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Refuse an inheritance: a family script, identity, or obligation you no longer consent to carry.

      **Activation Clause:**
      Name it out loud to family, peer or journal.

      **Point of No Return:**
      If they say yes, the door is opened.

      If you do it with someone who wants you to refuse, then it is only theater.

  - id: "minotaur:006"
    title: "The Witness Invitation"
    tags: [witness, courage, visibility, exposure]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Choose someone you trust. Invite them to witness you perform a Minotaur card.

      **Activation Clause:**
      You must accept the possibility of being seen and still misunderstood.

      **Requirements:**
      • Tell them what you’re doing.
      • Ask only for presence, not reassurance.

      Performing for praise is theater.

  - id: "minotaur:007"
    title: "The Unshielded Ear"
    tags: [listening, critique, humility, feedback]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Invite someone you trust (or harmed) to tell you their unfiltered critique of your behavior or impact.

      **Activation Clause:**
      Listen without interruption, defense, or visible reaction.

      **Requirements:**
      • Minimum of five minutes.
      • When they are done, say "Thank you."

      No rebuttals. Walk away or close the conversation.

  - id: "minotaur:008"
    title: "The Physical Hold"
    tags: [presence, body, attention, intensity]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      During another Minotaur card action, keep sustained eye contact and physical presence

      **Activation Clause:**
      Once contact is made, do not look away, fidget or gesture nervously.

      **Requirements:**
      • Remain bodily present throughout.
      • Give your undivided attention.

      Do not use this as a power move.

  - id: "minotaur:009"
    title: "The Inventory"
    tags: [accountability, reflection, avoidance, honesty]
    body: |-
      **Action:**
      Name aloud the Minotaur cards you have not performed. Name why.

      **Activation Clause:**
      Commit to finding what you are avoiding.

      **Requirements:**
      • Say it to a trusted friend, peer, partner, or even a mirror.
      • No explanation. No reframing.

      Once named, avoidance has structure. Rationalize delays are only justification.
