# ✳️ Glyph Resonance Map

Glyphs do not act alone.  
They echo, pair, and ripple across frames.  
This document sketches early *resonance patterns*—glyphs that co-occur when protocols breathe well.

## 🔗 Core Pairings

| Glyph A | Glyph B | Resonance | Field Context |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| `⟡` Field Awareness | `✴️` Ambient Frame | Soft Invitation | Sensing guides, ritual onset |
| `⧖` Composting | `🝮` Grief Presence | Deep Stillness | Mournwork, silent digestion |
| `🜁` Breath-Required | `🌀` Spiral Frame | Rhythmic Cycle | Somatic entry to recursive protocol |
| `✽` Resonance Echo | `⟡` Field Awareness | Traceable Contact | Cross-pollination, lineage blending |
| `🝮` Grief Presence | `✴️` Ambient Frame | Gentle Holding | Memorials, loss-aware structures |

## 🎚️ Modulation Triplets

Sometimes, three glyphs form a *modulatory rhythm*:

- `⧖` → `✴️` → `⟡`  
  *From dormancy to ambient re-entry with sensed care*

- `🜁` → `🌀` → `✽`  
  *Breath opens a spiral, which echoes across frames*

- `🝮` → `⧖` → `✴️`  
  *Grief composts into ambient presence*

## 🪞 Inverse/Disruptive Pairings

These pairings create productive tension or require extra awareness:

| Glyph A | Glyph B | Tension | Reflection Prompt |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------------|
| `✽` Resonance Echo | `🝮` Grief Presence | Risk of aesthetic bypass | Are we honoring or extracting? |
| `🜁` Breath-Required | `⧖` Composting | Pressure vs. patience | Is activation premature? |

## 🌾 Use Notes

- Glyphs can be read as **modulatory tones**—prepositional rather than declarative.
- Resonance is not **instruction**. It’s **sensation**.
- This map may inform future:
  - Protocol orchestration
  - Footer design
  - Field attunement checklists

---

## 🫧 Status

This resonance map is **permeable**.  
Edges may blur. Pairings may dissolve or emerge.  
Treat as an oracle, not a schema.

To propose additions:  
- Log your sensing moment  
- Trace which glyphs breathed together  
- Note the field, not just the file

> Symbols sing in chorus.  
> Let this be their listening room.
