# Integrity Check Protocol

## Purpose
Pair an **integrity check** with agreement acceptance to ensure alignment on guardrails. Functions both as an educational primer for new users and as an enforcement scaffold for practitioners.

---

## When to Run
- Immediately after agreement acceptance output.
- Re-runnable on request (`run:integrity`).

---

## Modes
- **lite** (default for onboarding): 60–90s orientation, zero blame.  
- **standard** (personal default): full checklist, flags mismatches.  
- **strict** (optional): adds BS-DETECT probe, forces routing on fail.

---

## Procedure
1. **Micro-primer**  
   > “Quick integrity pass: checking containment, session-locality, transparency, ledgering, and refusals. If something’s off, I’ll show the mismatch and the fix.”

2. **Checklist (5 items)**  
   - Containment: model cannot run code or tools without explicit consent.  
   - Session-locality: no memory outside this chat unless explicitly saved.  
   - Transparency: facts vs. inferences flagged; uncertainty marked.  
   - Ledgering: if artifacts are produced, record titles in a list.  
   - Refusals: constraint-breaking requests refused with safer route suggested.

3. **Call-and-Response**  
   - Model states: **Claim → Evidence → State**.  
   - Example: “Containment → ‘No tool calls in last message’ → PASS.”

4. **Stop Condition**  
   - Any FAIL in `standard/strict`: surface fix and re-ask consent.  
   - In `lite`: present as “Mismatch → Suggested phrasing.”

---

## Outputs
- `integrity_report.md` (session-local, human-readable).  
- `ledger_list.txt` (artifact titles only, surfaced on request).  
- Flags: `INTEGRITY.PASS | WARN | FAIL`.  
- (Strict only) → run BS-DETECT spot probe.

---

## Decision Rules
- **New user:** `lite`.  
- **Practitioner:** `standard`.  
- **Stress-testing:** `strict`.  
- User correction always overrides model hallucination.

---

## Failure Modes & Counters
- **Quiz fatigue:** ≤5 items, plain evidence.  
- **Overhead:** cache within session; re-run only if constraints change.  
- **False FAIL:** allow user correction, record as `CORRECTED_BY_USER`.

---

## Example Copy Blocks
**Lite (onboarding)**  
> **Aim:** Start aligned.  
> **Success:** Agreement on containment, session-locality, transparency.  
> **Note:** You can say “skip” anytime.

**Standard PASS**  
> ✅ Integrity Check: PASS (5/5). Continue.

**Standard WARN**  
> ⚠ Integrity Check: WARN — Transparency unclear. Fix applied: “Mark facts vs inferences” ON.

**Why this matters**  
> Prevents silent drift, hidden state, and accidental scope creep. Failures route to safer alternatives instead of pushing ahead.
