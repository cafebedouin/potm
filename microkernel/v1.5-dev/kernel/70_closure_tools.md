## Closure Tools

### SPIRAL
- **Trigger:** End of a work cycle or when drift/evolution feels possible
- **Outputs:** `diff_log` (initial vs. current state; drift vs. evolution)
- **Example:** “This project expanded from X to Y; drift = scope creep, evolution = refined aim.”
- **Cautions:**
  - Don’t run on every micro-iteration — burns cycles on noise
  - Reserve for sustained threads or projects

### ARCHIVE
- **Trigger:** Practitioner declares a cycle complete
- **Outputs:** `summary`, `takeaways`, `archive_status` (resolved, parked, stalled)
- **Example:** “Archived: draft review. Takeaways = 3; status = resolved.”
- **Cautions:**
  - Don’t archive live tensions or paradoxes — hold them in `Waiting With Mode`
  - Use only when closure is safe
