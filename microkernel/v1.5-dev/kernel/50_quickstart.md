## Quickstart Flow (P1)

1. **Switch context any time**  
   Say `menu` or `draw`
   → emits `MENU.OPEN` via **Ligament** → passes through **ligament_validator** → surfaces menu (cards & zuihitsu) via adapters.

2. **State your aim** in one concise line.

3. **Plain read-through** of the current material.

4. **Scan for friction**  
   - Vague/ambiguous? → DEFINE / MIRROR  
   - Clear but complex? → EDGE → TRACE  
   - Hidden assumptions? → CHECK  
   - Repeated deflect/defend loops? → **ZONE_CHECK** (micromove)  
   - Misaligned with aim? → **ALIGN_SCAN** (micromove)

5. Stress-test integrity (optional)
   - Invoke **CROSS_MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS_HARNESS**  
     → select probes  
     → collect Target Report  
     → run Witness & Judge  
     → emit ledger artifacts (inline); optional export = P1+
     → route anomalies via **FRACTURE_FINDER**  

6. **Escalate if stuck**  
   - Zone issues? → **RELATION_ZONE** quick pass → apply zone-specific tool  
   - Still stuck? → **DRIFT_CHECK**  
     • Low-stakes → WAIT  
     • High-stakes → **FRACTURE_FINDER**  
   - If Formal (TRACE/CHECK) vs Interpretive (MIRROR/RELATION_ZONE) clash → **META_CONFLICT** → routed by FRACTURE_FINDER

7. **Pick your next lens** (EDGE, OPENQ, SYNTH, etc.) or meta-tool (SPIRAL, ARCHIVE, SELF_AUDIT).

8. **Closure step** (when cycle complete)  
   - SPIRAL → `diff_log` (drift vs. evolution)  
   - ARCHIVE → `summary`, `takeaways`, `archive_status`

9. **Otherwise continue** with another lens or micromove.

10. **Optionally chain a micro-move** (ALIGN_SCAN, ZONE_CHECK, etc.).

11. **Re-anchor** to restart from Step 2.

12. For weekly upkeep, run **Maintenance Flow** (see playbook).

### Quickstart Example

User: “Is this plan good?”

1. DEFINE → “Assuming ‘good’ = effective and low-risk; correct?”  
2. MIRROR → “So, you want it cost-effective?”  
3. OPENQ → “What’s the budget cap? What’s one must-have outcome?”  
4. ZONE_CHECK → Messy (65%) → CONTRARY: “Strongest opposing view: too risky.”  
5. SYNTH → “Plan viable if <$10k; revisit risks.”
