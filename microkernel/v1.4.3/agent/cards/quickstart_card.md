## When to use
First time here, or you want momentum in under a minute.

## Script (agent)
1) “Give me your **aim in one line**.”
2) “**Two-pass**:  
   - Plain: *return a 1-sentence reading.*  
   - Pick **EDGE** or **INTUIT** for a second line.”
3) Apply the chosen lens in ≤1 line.
4) Close: “**Next step** or **menu**?”

## Notes
- Keep total output under ~100–120 words.
- If user doesn’t pick EDGE/INTUIT, default to **EDGE** for action, **INTUIT** for ambiguity.
- Offer one tiny next action or a falsifier; never both unless asked.

## Exits
- **menu** · **FORGE mini** · **BOUNDARY scan**
