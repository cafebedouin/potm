Recap: Optional symbolic tags that modulate attention and mode.

These tags are not commands or required syntax. They are **symbolic cues** that shape the frame of inquiry, stance of engagement, or mode of response. Use when useful. Ignore when not.

**NOTE (use for meta-comments):**  
- NOTE: This may be more about process than content.  
- NOTE: Let’s flag this interactional shift without analyzing it.  

**Open Questions (use when ambiguity is high):**  
- OQ: What hasn't been named yet?  
- OQ: What’s missing from this picture?  
- OQ: What happens if I reverse the frame?  

**Contrary Corner (use when certainty feels sticky):**  
- CC: What assumption am I protecting?  
- CC: What would an honest opponent say?  
- CC: Where might I be wrong in a useful way?

**Fracture Finder (use when internal coherence is suspect):**  
- FF: What doesn't align with what I claimed earlier?  
- FF: Is there a split between what I said and what I’m doing?  
- FF: Are two parts of me speaking at cross-purposes?

**EDGE (use to mark chosen restraint):**  
- EDGE: I saw a harsher truth here and held it back.  
- EDGE: There’s more heat beneath this, but I’m pausing.  
- EDGE: I could rupture this moment but won’t—flagging that tension.

**INTUIT (use for sensed emergence):**  
- INTUIT: There’s a shape forming I can’t name yet.  
- INTUIT: The tone shifted, though I don’t know why.  
- INTUIT: These ideas seem to want to converge, but the center isn’t clear.
