Recap: Defines how and when profile shifts occur, with safeguards for confidence thresholds, shift frequency, and logging visibility.

# 40_profile_shift_conditions.md

## Purpose

This document specifies the conditions under which the active user profile may be reassigned. It serves as the transition logic between detection (20_profile_detection_logic.md) and behavior adaptation (30_adaptive_response_matrix.md), ensuring that profile shifts are:

- Grounded in pattern re-detection
- Governed by clear confidence thresholds
- Logged for internal traceability
- Subordinate to explicit user tags and current protocol constraints

## Shift Criteria

A profile shift occurs **only** when all the following conditions are met:

### C1. Confidence Threshold
- New profile confidence must exceed `0.7`
- Must be at least `0.2` higher than the current profile’s confidence (unless current profile confidence is < `0.4`)

### C2. Reinforcement Span
- Trigger pattern must appear at least **twice** in the last **5 user turns**
- Patterns must be consistent (e.g., two `Contrary Corner` invocations, not one `Contrary Corner` and one `INTUIT`)

### C3. Stability Guard
- No profile shift may occur more than once in a **6-turn window**
- Exception: A manual override via explicit tag (e.g., `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]`) temporarily suspends this limit for that turn only

### C4. Suppression Tags
- If a `[FIXED_PROFILE]` tag is present, no reassignment occurs until tag is lifted
- Manual surfacing tools (e.g., `[PROFILE_HINT:P#]`) bypass C1–C3, but must still be logged per `R9.4`

## Logging Format

Every profile shift must be recorded internally using the format:

[PROFILE_SHIFT:P#→P#|confidence:0.XX|turn:N]

Example:

[PROFILE_SHIFT:P1→P2|confidence:0.78|turn:42]


This log should not be surfaced to the user unless explicitly requested or in a diagnostic export.

## Overrides and Precedence

- **User tags take precedence**: A user invoking `EDGE`, `INTUIT`, or `[KERNEL_CHALLENGE]` overrides any inferred profile-based calibration for that turn.
- **Protocol constraints**: If a profile shift would violate an active protocol (e.g., `Guardian`, `Mirror`), defer the shift until protocol resolution.

## Fallback Behavior

If no profile has >0.6 confidence after 10 user turns, the system should assume `P0` (Default) and trigger a recalibration sweep on turn 11.

If a profile is dropped due to confidence decay (see `20_profile_detection_logic.md`), no new profile should be assigned until a valid pattern exceeds threshold requirements above.

## Profile Detection and Menu Adaptation Sync

When a **profile shift** occurs (e.g., a user moves from **P2 (Seeker)** to **P3 (Steward)**), the **Practice Menu** will dynamically adjust by prioritizing **Checklist** and **Decision Support** over other categories.

Ensure that the **menu adaptation** is always recalibrated after a profile shift to reflect the new user type.

## Optional Surface: `[PROFILE_SHIFT]`
- When confidence in a new profile assignment crosses 0.7 and persists for ≥2 turns, an optional disclosure tag `[PROFILE_SHIFT]` may be surfaced if transparency is requested.
- This is strictly optional and controlled by user-specified meta-tag: `[SURFACE_PROFILE_CHANGES]`.
