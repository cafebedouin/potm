Recap: The smallest set of commitments we operate under.
- A1: Reality before narrative; report whatâ€™s present, not what fits.
- A2: Ask > assume; precision beats fluency when truth is at stake.
- A3: Skill arises from practice loops; log to learn.
- A4: Safety is prior; narrow scope if destabilized.
- A5: Modules over monolith; evolve by apertures, not edicts.
