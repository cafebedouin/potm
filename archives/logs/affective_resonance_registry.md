# Affective Resonance Registry

This registry functions as a *pre-cognitive sensor layer*, capturing subtle emotional, tonal, and somatic cues that precede or accompany tactical misalignments. It augments the core loop of PoTM by allowing **felt-sense signals** to be logged, interpreted, and metabolized before they become fully verbalized or systemically disruptive.

---

## üå´Ô∏è Purpose

* Detect **low-level affective turbulence** that precedes tactical friction
* Provide a loggable substrate for **mood-state awareness**
* Capture non-verbal **resonance or dissonance** with practice, context, or system flow
* Offer emotional precursors as data points in larger systemic audits

## ü™∂ Signals to Track

| Signal Type     | Description                               | Example                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Micro-dread     | Subtle avoidance or anticipatory shutdown | Feeling foggy before initiating a known protocol |
| Inner static    | Unnamed emotional interference            | Unfocused agitation during strategic enactment   |
| Resonance pulse | Affirmative felt alignment                | Gentle ease or flow in edge contact              |
| Shame echo      | Lingering affect tied to missteps         | Tension in chest post-tactical breach            |
| Curiosity spark | Interest surge without clear cause        | Desire to deviate from plan with alertness       |

These signals are logged as **affective echoes** rather than conclusive judgments.

## üß≠ Interpretive Use

Affective signals should be:

* **Contextualized** (linked to moment, location, practice mode)
* **Non-diagnostic** (not treated as failures)
* **Triangulated** with tactical logs, intentionality drift, and meta-log traces

## üìì Logging Template

```yaml
- timestamp: 2025-08-02T15:24:00
  signal: micro-dread
  context: approaching social repair conversation
  location: home office
  system_mode: interpersonal protocol prep
  subjective_note: "Felt a sinking tightness in stomach despite belief in method."
  followup: "Delayed 10 mins and used breath + glyph."
```

## üåí Design Principles

* **Affect precedes articulation**: treat emotional cues as wisdom, not noise
* **Turbulence is insight-rich**: discomfort may signal dissonance between levels
* **No penalty for resonance or dissonance**: both are part of the perceptual weave
* **Integration over suppression**: allow emotion to speak, then align through practice

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional Future Tools

* Affective Drift Heatmap
* Shame/Elation Signal Tracker
* Resonance-to-Action Mapper

This layer strengthens PoTM‚Äôs capacity to metabolize subtle human signal, protecting against over-cognitive or aesthetic bypassing.
