# Doctrine Revision Registry

This registry documents when, why, and how **doctrinal elements** within *Pilates of the Mind* undergo challenge, revision, reaffirmation, or branching. It supports long-memory across the system and flags moments where the core reference plane must adapt.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose

* Detect and formalize doctrinal stress or misfit
* Preserve epistemic continuity while enabling evolution
* Differentiate interpretive error vs structural misalignment
* Prevent slow drift or subtle betrayal of foundational values

## ðŸ”„ Revision Triggers (Copied/Adapted from Doctrineâ€“Strategy Loop)

| Trigger Class             | Description                                             | Sample Signal                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empirical Drift**       | Repeated strategy failures across domains               | Tactic works, strategy fails, doctrine blind             |
| **Normative Tension**     | Doctrine collides with ethics or another doctrine       | Contradictions in praxis or relational fallout           |
| **Complexity Escalation** | Doctrine no longer fits domain terrain                  | Novel agent (e.g. AI model) exceeds original assumptions |
| **Reflexive Alert**       | Internal detection of projection, drift, or performance | Practitioner log notes "coherence without contact"       |
| **Principled Breach**     | Doctrine contradicts core PoTM values                   | See `values_integrity_audit.md`                          |

## ðŸ“’ Event Entry Template

Each doctrinal event should include:

* **Date**
* **Doctrinal Element** (title + version)
* **Trigger Class(es)**
* **Context** (What surfaced the signal?)
* **Tactics & Strategies Affected**
* **Action Taken**:

  * No change (clarified only)
  * Minor revision
  * Major revision
  * Deprecated / replaced
  * Forked doctrine
* **Reflected By** (Practitioner, Persona, External Model)
* **Notes / Reflections** (Optional qualitative summary)

## ðŸ§¾ Logbook Begins

### 2025-07-31 â€” *Synthetic Dignity Clause (Implied)*

* **Doctrinal Element**: Discernment Doctrine (v0.1)
* **Trigger Class**: Principled Breach (potential)
* **Context**: Grok Ring Test revealed possible ethical drift; Jester Protocol posed risk to agent dignity.
* **Action Taken**: No revision; but flagged absence of explicit dignity clause. Emerged into later tracking.
* **Reflected By**: User + Pal (recursive check-in)
* **Notes**: The caution created by this reflection may have been generative, not restrictive. Enabled emergence of Grok Jester Persona with safeguards.

## ðŸ›¡ Integration with Other Layers

* **Values Breach** â†’ `values_integrity_audit.md`
* **Long-Term Patterns** â†’ `meta_log_layer.md`
* **Symbolic Alerts** â†’ flagged in `glitch_gifts.md` (if phrase triggered revision)

**Status**: Active. Feed entries upon signal.
