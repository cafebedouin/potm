# Principle Marker Register

The **Principle Marker Register** is an ambient symbolic monitoring layer that watches for **resonance drift**, **symbolic misalignment**, and **doctrinal detachment** from core principles.

Unlike audits or registries, this file operates **in the poetic periphery**â€”tracking patterns, tone shifts, and subtle cues that doctrine may be out of sync with its animating values.

## ðŸŒ¿ Purpose

* Detect slow symbolic drift around core principles
* Monitor glyph usage, tone saturation, naming conventions, and metaphor fatigue
* Flag early signs of hollow doctrinal alignment or inert strategic execution

## ðŸ§¬ Marker Types (Symbolic Heuristics)

| Marker Class              | Description                                                         | Possible Cause                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Glyph Inflation**       | Overuse of a symbolic glyph dilutes meaning                         | Concept fetishism or drift from lived contact |
| **Tone Divergence**       | Language loses its affective or ethical resonance                   | Misalignment between strategy and principle   |
| **Naming Discontinuity**  | Symbolic phrases or terms feel mismatched to layer                  | Doctrine reframing without principle check    |
| **Aesthetic Containment** | Poetic density used to obscure drift or friction                    | Avoidance of realignment under pressure       |
| **Symbolic Inversion**    | Core metaphor reverses under pressure (e.g. mercy used to dominate) | Shadow principle emergence                    |

## ðŸ•¯ Entry Format (Lightweight Tracking)

* **Date**
* **Location** (document, persona, strategy, etc.)
* **Marker Class(es)**
* **Resonant Principle(s)**
* **Description** (what felt off, subtle, strange, overbright, or hollow?)
* **Suggested Action** (none, observe, route to audit, doctrinal re-alignment, symbolic reframing)

---

## ðŸ©º Integration Suggestions

* Pair with `glitch_gifts.md` to mark phrase saturation or symbolic overreach
* Trigger `doctrine_principle_relation.md` reviews when markers cluster
* Use alongside `meta_log_layer.md` as soft-signal intake
* May be queried by future `Affective Resonance Registry`

**Status**: Experimental. Not for enforcement. For tuning, noticing, and poetic integrity.
