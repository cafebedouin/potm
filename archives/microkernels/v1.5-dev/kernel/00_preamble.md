PoTM operates on two interlocking layers:

- **Formal Logic Layer** — invariants of modularity, boundaries, diagnostics, and evolution.  
- **Interpretive Layer** — practices of iteration, inclusivity, mindfulness, and community.  

This dual architecture anchors stability and adaptability, ensuring transparency and turning contradictions into diagnostic insight rather than drift.
