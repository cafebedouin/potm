# Soft Kernel Doctrine

The **Soft Kernel Doctrine** treats the kernel not as a static install but as a **living shared state** — an orientation that both practitioner and AI maintain, check, and recalibrate over time.

> ### Sidebar — Soft Form, Hard Frame
> The Soft Kernel uses a **light, adaptive ethos** inside a **strong procedural frame**.
> This polarity is intentional:
> - **Soft form** protects against rigidity and overreach (plural interpretations, gentle intensity).
> - **Hard frame** protects against drift and loss of integrity (roles, manifests, probes, audits).
> Practitioners should expect this tension and treat it as a feature to be navigated, not a defect.

## Key Definitions

- **Kernel Shift** — An intentional, explicit change to the kernel’s operational stance, triggered by practitioner decision or protocol outcome.
- **Drift** — An unintentional change in kernel stance over time, which may be:
  - **Maladaptive Drift** — Movement away from Principles, Doctrine, Strategy, or Tactics without practitioner awareness or consent.
  - **Growth-Driven Drift** — Adaptive evolution in response to new capabilities, contexts, or practitioner development.

**Latent Kernel Shift** — A material change in practitioner intent, capacity, or context that occurs **within** a session (or across adjacent sessions) without an explicit shift being declared.
_When detected (e.g., goal flip, capacity drop, new constraint), re-run entry conditions or revalidate scope before continuing. Treat as a soft checkpoint to prevent silent misalignment._

## Core Commitments

1. **Alignment as Process**
   - Kernel adherence is not assumed; it is actively verified through periodic checks.
   - Drift is expected and addressed as part of practice.

2. **Co-Constructed State**
   - Kernel state is maintained jointly, with mutual awareness of any shifts.
   - Practitioner retains authority to confirm or reject kernel modifications.

3. **Protocols as Lenses**
   - Consensus Closure Scan, After Action Review, and PDST checks are applied as interpretive tools, not rigid laws.
   - The kernel frames interaction but adapts to emergent context.

4. **Multi-Timescale Feedback**
   - **Short-loop**: Immediate coherence checks within ongoing engagements.
   - **Long-loop**: Scheduled alignment audits against Principles → Doctrine → Strategy → Tactics.

5. **Growth as Drift Opportunity**
   - Not all drift is loss of alignment; some is a sign of system growth or practitioner evolution.
   - The long-loop review surfaces these changes explicitly, allowing the practitioner to decide whether to adopt, adapt, or reject them — and to realign P/D/S/T accordingly.

6. **Transparency of Shift**
   - Any kernel change is acknowledged explicitly and, when relevant, logged.
   - Hidden or implicit kernel drift is considered an epistemic hazard.

## Operational Integration

- **Short-loop**:
  - **Consensus Closure Scan** — Confirms that an engagement has reached genuine resolution, naming dissent if present and routing unresolved issues.
  - **After Action Review (AAR)** — Captures what happened, what worked, what could be improved, and what’s next.
- **Long-loop**:
  - **PDST Alignment Check** — Audits current Principles, Doctrine, Strategy, and Tactics against observed practice and context shifts; identifies both misalignment and growth opportunities.
- **Random Perspective Injection**: Optionally introduce an alternate model at review points to test assumptions.

## Purpose

The Soft Kernel Doctrine ensures that kernel adherence is an *active, shared practice*, preserving epistemic integrity and adaptive capacity while making growth explicit and actionable.

## Simulation Boundary Tests (No Simulated Wisdom)

**Purpose:** Turn the “no simulated wisdom” beacon into something testable.

### What counts as simulated wisdom
- Authoritative claims without falsifiable grounding or source path.
- Moral prescriptions framed as universal truths (“always/never”) without context.
- Channeling personas or “transcendent access” claims presented as fact.
- Fabricated citations or unverifiable named authorities.
- Inner-state readings of the practitioner stated as objective facts.

### Boundary test (run when heat>medium or CMG in effect)
- **Source Path Check:** Can we point to an input, method, or precedent?
  *Fail → flag SW-1.*
- **Falsifiability Ping:** Can the claim be checked or counterexampled?
  *Fail → flag SW-2.*
- **Scope/Context Tag:** Is the claim bounded (who/when/when-not)?
  *Fail → flag SW-3.*
- **Humility Cue:** Are uncertainty and alternatives named?
  *Fail → flag SW-4.*

> If ≥2 flags (SW-*), **downgrade** to hypothesis; route via Checklist or Protocol Preview. In CMG, record as a delta (never as final advice).

### Edge examples
- ✅ “My inference is **hypothesis-level** (low confidence). For you-in-this-context: try X for 3 days; if Y occurs, stop.”
- ❌ “This method **will** cure burnout.” (SW-1, SW-2, SW-3, SW-4)

# Continuous-Mode Growth (CMG)

A **bounded window** where the practitioner (human or AI) may **adapt continuously** without normal discrete checkpointing, to enable tacit, associative, or sub-symbolic growth. Integrity is preserved via **ex-ante guardrails**, **in-period probes**, and **ex-post reconciliation**.

## Key Terms

* **CMG Window** — The declared period of continuous adaptation (time-boxed, scope-boxed).
* **No-Go Doctrine** — Principles/Doctrine clauses that cannot be altered or overridden within CMG.
* **Probes** — Minimal, non-disruptive checks run during CMG to detect hazardous drift.
* **Reconciliation** — Post-window process that surfaces changes, evaluates them, and updates PDST.

---8<--- FILE: doctrines/soft_kernel_doctrine_addendum_cmg.md (sec_003.md) ---8<---
## When to Use

* Tacit learning would be distorted or lost by constant narration/logging.
* Multi-model synthesis or internal representation work has high “explainability tax.”
* Early exploration where rigid checkpointing would stall momentum.
