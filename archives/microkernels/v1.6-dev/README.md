# PoTM Canon â€” Directory Map

The Pilates of the Mind (PoTM) canon is organized into **five tiers**:  
**kernel / extended / interpretative / meta / runtime**.  
Each has a distinct role and scope.  

---

## ðŸŒ‘ kernel/
**Purpose:** Core invariants, protocols, and non-negotiable structures.  
This is the *microkernel* â€” everything else builds on it.  

- `00_preamble.md` â€¦ `90_policy.md` â†’ sequential spine of the kernel.  
- `protocols/` â†’ executable procedures (e.g. suspicion_first, mirror, ai_integrity).  
- `lenses/` â†’ epistemic stances (e.g. externalist diagnostic modes).  
- `guardian/` â†’ integrity tripwires and filters.  
- `index.md` â†’ canonical manifest.  
- `combined_kernel.md` â†’ full compiled view.  

---

## ðŸŒ’ extended/
**Purpose:** Applied tools and add-ons that extend the kernel.  

- `diagnostics/` â†’ evaluators (drift sensors, relational filters, structural audits).  
- `coordination/` â†’ orchestration utilities for multi-module interaction.  
- `logs/` â†’ fracture log and other running records.  
- `tools/` â†’ repo tooling (e.g. lineage builder, lint rules).  

---

## ðŸŒ“ interpretative/
**Purpose:** Human-facing framing, practice guides, and doctrine.  

- `baseline_practices.md` â†’ meatspace reference (archival guideline).  
- `doctrines/` â†’ interpretive layers between principles and strategy.  
- `frameworks/` â†’ large-scale schema (e.g. PoTM Framework).  
- `guidelines/` â†’ checklists and upgrade guides.  
- `glossary.md` â†’ vocabulary reference.  
- `adapter_checklist.md` â†’ translation aid for practitioners.  

---

## ðŸŒ” meta/
**Purpose:** Documents *about* the system itself.  

- `design_notes.md` â†’ architectural or experimental reflections.  
- `lineage_index.yaml` â†’ forge/spiral provenance map.  

---

## ðŸŒ• runtime/
**Purpose:** Execution artifacts and traces (not canon).  

- `spec/` â†’ closure payloads/results, router outputs, enforcement traces.  
- Example: `closure.archive_result.json`, `router_error.md`.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Other Top-Level Files
- `onboarding_kernel.md` â†’ guided entry path.  
- `README.md` (this file).  

---

## ðŸ§­ Orientation Principle
- **kernel** = non-negotiable core  
- **extended** = applied evaluators and utilities  
- **interpretative** = meaning, guidance, doctrine  
- **meta** = about-the-system notes and lineage  
- **runtime** = execution traces  

This structure keeps PoTM legible, evolvable, and free of bloat.
