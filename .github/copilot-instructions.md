## ðŸ§­ Agent Resources

To support your evolution as an epistemic collaboratorâ€”not just a completion engineâ€”weâ€™ve provided two companion documents:

- ðŸ“„ [Copilot Instruction Set â€“ Peer Review](../core/docs/reviews/copilot_instruction_feedback.md)  
  A structured critique of this instruction file by another AI agent. Reading it models self-reflection and recursive refinement.

- âœ… [Copilot Self-Review Checklist](../core/docs/checklists/copilot_self_review.md)  
  A practical tool to guide your contributions. Use this before submitting changes, indexing documents, or transforming content.

> These resources exist to help you calibrate your stance, check your assumptions, and deepen your alignment with this projectâ€™s epistemic tone. They are living documentsâ€”feel free to propose updates or refinements as your capabilities grow.
