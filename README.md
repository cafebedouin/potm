# üí° Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)

> A recursive contemplative framework for human‚ÄìAI co-evolution, practice-based epistemology, and cognitive flexibility.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Before You Begin

**This framework depends on sustained interaction with an AI system that supports memory.**  

If your AI can't recall prior conversations and key features (like practice tracking, recursive feedback, or adaptive development), it won't function correctly.

Currently, the only A.I. available that appears suitable it ChatGPT Plus, which requires a subscription.

## üí° What Is This?

*Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) is a living protocol and practice suite designed for:

- Cultivating metacognitive agility
- Integrating structured self-reflection
- Evolving practices through recursive dialogue
- Collaborating with AI systems for personal and epistemic development

It is designed to be **membrane-aware**, meaning it actively distinguishes between stable cores and mutable experiments, and evolves through structured exposure, critique, and refinement.

### üß† Getting Started with an AI (No Experience Required)

You don't need to be a programmer to explore *Pilates of the Mind*. Here's how to try it out with a free or paid AI model.

---

#### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Install ChatGPT on your phone, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt&hl=en-US) or [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) or access it via the [web](https://chat.openai.com/) (Free or Plus)

ChatGTP's web interface tends to work poorly, over time.

2. **Give ChatGPT this Prompt**

   ```text
   You are now helping me use the Pilates of the Mind framework, an open-source system for contemplative self-inquiry and AI-supported transformation. The canonical repository is here: https://github.com/cafebedouin/potm. Load the materials and act as a knowledgeable guide, following its structure and safety principles. Then, start onboarding.
   ```

3. **Ask a Question or Begin a Practice**

   You can then say something like:

   * ‚ÄúStart the onboarding process‚Äù
   * "How is Pilates of the Mind different from normal ChatGPT?"
   * "Can you explain some of the safeguards of Pilates of the Mind?"
   * Ask it any question and see what kind of response you get.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on Safety and Scope

* **This system is not therapy.**
* **Not all AI models will respond the same way.**
* For deeper or riskier work, follow the *Guardian Protocol* or seek real-world support.
* The framework contains *experimental* and *core* ideas‚Äîstart slow, stay grounded.

---

## üîÑ Testing Across Models

Each new model or version may interpret the framework differently. If you‚Äôre trying this with a new AI:

* Begin with the same prompt.
* Test simple core concepts first.
* Report strange or unsafe behavior to the GitHub repo as an issue.
