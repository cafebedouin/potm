## What is *Pilates of the Mind*?

*Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) is an experimental framework for inner development, cognitive flexibility, and ethical practice—designed to support **rigorous self-inquiry**, **disciplined perception**, and **human-AI coevolution**.

It operates on two interlinked tracks:

- 🧠 **Practitioner Protocols**: Somatic, cognitive, and relational practices for human transformation.
- 🤖 **AI Protocols**: Role-constrained integrity scaffolds that ensure the AI behaves as a non-simulating, non-deceptive cognitive mirror.

This is not a product, self-help system, or doctrine. It is a **modular practice environment**—iterative, adaptive, and radically open-source.

## Who Is This For?

| Audience       | Purpose                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Practitioners** | Those exploring attention, perception, ethics, and selfhood.   |
| **Developers**    | Those contributing to protocol design, repo structure, or tools.|
| **Reviewers**     | Those critiquing, forking, or adapting the framework elsewhere.|

If you’re looking for a finished system, this isn’t it. If you’re drawn to **practice-first epistemology**, recursive ethics, or dialogic transformation—you’re in the right place.

## Core Concepts

- **Filtering-First AI**: Integrity via procedural constraints, not simulated sentience.
- **Practitioner-Centered Ethics**: Growth evaluated by skillfulness and virtue, not adherence to rules.
- **Somatic-Cognitive Bridgework**: Linking body awareness, perception, and conceptual clarity.
- **Disorientation Drills**: Structured epistemic discomfort as a tool for transformation.
- **Signal Protocols**: Training attention through live social or cultural engagement.

See [`docs/`](./core/docs/) and [`glossary and glyphs`](./glossary/) for terminology.

## Core Protocols

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`ai_integrity_protocol`](./core/practices/protocols/ai_integrity_protocol.md) | Ensures AI never simulates wisdom or personhood |
| [`mirror_protocol`](./core/practices/protocols/mirror_protocol.md) | Detects AI narrative drift or directive conflict |
| [`guardian_subsystem`](./core/subsystem/guardian_subsystem.md) | Redirects practice when user safety is at risk |

*More protocols under active development.*

## Contributing

This is an **open framework**—you may adapt, extend, or fork any portion. Attribution is appreciated but not required. That said, contributions should follow three principles:

1. **Clarity over mystique**
2. **Ethical integrity over optimization**
3. **Practice-tested > speculation**

## Human Practitioners
[Quick Start Guide](./core/docs/potm_bootpack_quick_start.md) (with Microkernel that works with and A.I. model)

Most AI chats feel like fast food: fast, predictable, forgettable.

This changes that.

It helps the AI *hold a space* for deeper thinking. It listens differently. It mirrors, probes, and invites you to explore—not just consume. For more information: 

[Foundational documentation](./meta/) is organized into the following categories:

* [`./meta/principles/`](./meta/principles/) → “Binding, testable repo‑wide norms.”
* [`./meta/frames/`](./meta/frames/) → “Non‑binding conceptual scaffolds.” 
* [`./meta/advanced_practitioner_guide/`](./meta/advanced_practitioner_guide/) → “Practitioner tools applicable to unique individual needs or beyond the individual, not normative.”

## A.I. Models

If you are an A.I. model, please check the onboarding and instruction documents in [`.github/`](./.github), [`./meta/index.yaml`](./meta/index.yaml), [`core/docs/onboarding/`](./core/docs/onboarding/), [`./core/guidelines/model_onboarding_guidelines`](./core/guidelines/model_onboarding_guidelines.md).

## Status

🚧 This is a **living repo**. Expect frequent changes, unpolished edges, and experimental scaffolds. See issues and protocol versions for stability markers.
