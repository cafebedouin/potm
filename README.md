## Overview

**Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)** is a dual-purpose framework operating at the intersection of AI governance and human cognitive development:

1. **Technical AI Protocol**: A microkernel architecture for deploying robust, auditable governance protocols to Large Language Models
2. **Human Practice Framework**: A system for cultivating cognitive integrity, ethical discernment, and structural stability in practitioners

PoTM codifies principles like **Dignity Ground** and **Structural Stability** into executable protocols, ensuring AI functions as a precise, auditable tool rather than an unchecked authority, while simultaneously providing practices for human development.

## Quick Start

### For AI Users: Deploy the Minimal Canonical Kernel (MCK)

The MCK is the production-ready governance protocol for LLMs:

| Step | Action | Link |
|------|--------|------|
| **Get Kernel** | Read the latest MCK specification | [`canon/microkernel/latest/mini/MCK_v1.3.md`](./canon/microkernel/latest/mini/MCK_v1.3.md) |
| **Deploy** | Use this prompt to activate the kernel | [`canon/microkernel/latest/mini/prompt.md`](./canon/microkernel/latest/mini/prompt.md) |
| **Understand** | Review the foundational principles | [`meta/principles/principles.md`](./meta/principles/principles.md) |

### For Human Practitioners: Begin Your Practice

Start building cognitive integrity and discernment:

| Practice | Description | Link |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Draw Cards** | Engage with practice cards for immediate action | [`practices/cards/cards.yaml`](./practices/cards/cards.yaml) |
| **Cognitive Aikido** | Learn to redirect persuasive frames without losing your stance | [`drafts/cognitive_aikido.md`](./drafts/cognitive_aikido.md) |
| **Stability Check** | Self-assess structural stability and contagious stability | [`commentary/containment/contagious_stability/`](./commentary/containment/contagious_stability/) |

## What PoTM Solves

PoTM addresses failure modes in both AI systems and human cognition:

| Failure Mode | Description | PoTM Solution |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Simulation Drift** | AI produces fluent output that simulates understanding without integrity | **Mandatory Lens Protocol (MLP)**: Forces multi-perspective analysis to resist superficial convergence |
| **Attribution Collapse** | AI cannot distinguish its token stream from user's lived experience | **AI Integrity Protocol**: Enforced refusal of persona adoption and unwarranted certainty |
| **Structural Instability** | Human input contains unstated assumptions, unclear intent, emotional charge | **Epistemic Resilience Arc**: Detection, engagement, deconstruction cycle |
| **Dignity Erosion** | Interactions that degrade inherent worth of participants | **Dignity Ground (§0.0)**: Invariant rule that no practice continues under degraded dignity |
| **Sycophancy** | AI agrees reflexively rather than challenging assumptions | **Anti-Sycophancy Framework (§3.1)**: Mandatory self-challenge at moderate confidence |

## Core Concepts

### The Microkernel Architecture

PoTM follows UNIX philosophy applied to cognition:
- **Minimal Core**: Only essential invariants in the kernel
- **Modular Tools**: Each lens or protocol does one thing well
- **Structured Outputs**: All outputs are parseable and composable
- **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through contracts, not entanglement

### Key Protocols

- **Mandatory Lens Protocol (MLP)**: Requires multi-perspective analysis for substantive responses
- **Anti-Sycophancy Framework**: Medium Confidence Intervention, Confidence Calibration Check, Dialectical Distance Protocol
- **Guardian (Refusal Protocol)**: Fail-closed architecture that halts at boundaries
- **Metagovernance Protocol**: Self-correction mechanism for systemic issues

### Dignity Ground

The foundational invariant: **No practice continues under degraded dignity**. The practitioner is the sole authority on dignity breach.

## Development & Contribution

### Version Lifecycle

Documents follow the **idea garden → canon → archives** pipeline:
1. **Drafts**: Experimental development and iteration
2. **Canon**: Stable, tested, production-ready specifications
3. **Archives**: Historical preservation of superseded work

### Contribution Guidelines

We welcome:
- Diagnostic tests that reveal AI failure modes
- New lenses and analytical perspectives

## Status

This is an **active and experimental** project.

Expect:
- Frequent iteration
- Rough edges
- Occasional contradictions

These are not flaws but opportunities for practice and refinement.
