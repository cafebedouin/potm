## What is *Pilates of the Mind*?

*Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) is an experimental framework for inner development, cognitive flexibility, and ethical practice. Itâ€™s built to support:

* **Rigorous self-inquiry**
* **Disciplined perception**
* **Humanâ€“AI co-evolution**

Think of it as a **modular practice environment** â€” part playground, part lab â€” for exploring how you think, and how AI can help you think better.

## Who Itâ€™s For & What You Do Here

| Role             | What Youâ€™ll Do                                                                                  | Key Links                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Practitioner** | Use practice cards, checklists, and guides to improve how you think and act in real situations. | [Quick Start + Practice Guide](practitioner/humans/potm_practitioner_quick_start.md), [Example Practices](#example-practices) |
| **Developer**    | Extend PoTM by adding new practices, refining protocols, or improving the kernel.               | [Kernel](latest/potm_bootpack_combined.md), [Design Manifesto](meta/principles/design_manifesto.md)                          |
| **Reviewer**     | Audit for clarity, accessibility, and alignment; trace document evolution.                      | [meta/](meta/), [PoTM Distinctions](meta/potm_distinctions.md)                                                      |

## Example Practices

Try these without knowing the full system â€” each is a 1-page, plain-language guide:

* [Relationship Checklist](practitioners/humans/reference/boundaries_guide.md)
* [Relationship Dignity Filter](practitioners/humans/reference/relationship_dignity_filter.md)
* [Center of Gravity](practitoners/humans/guides/center_of_gravity.md)
* [Contrary Corner / EDGE](practitioners/humans/guides/contrary_corner.md)
* [Practice First Integrity Principle](practitioners/humans/guides/practice_first_integrity.md)
* [Boundaries](practitioners/humans/guides/boundaries_guide.md)

## Quick Start for Practitioners

1. **Pick an example practice** from the list above.
2. **Do it once today** â€” takes 1â€“5 minutes.
3. **Notice what changes** in your mood, clarity, or actions.
4. Repeat daily for a week if it feels useful.

Once youâ€™ve tried a few, explore the [Practice Card Deck](practitioners/humans/practices/cards/card_bank.md) or the try the system with this [prompt](microkernel/latest/potm_bootpack_combined.md) in your favorite A.I. model, just cut and paste.

## Core Concepts

* **Filtering-First AI** â€“ Integrity via procedural constraints, not simulated sentience.
* **Practitioner-Centered Ethics** â€“ Growth measured by skillfulness, not rigid rules.
* **Somaticâ€“Cognitive Bridgework** â€“ Linking body awareness and conceptual clarity.
* **Signal Protocols** â€“ Live engagement with social or cultural inputs.

See [`practices/canon`](practices/canon/) and [`glossary`](`practices/canon/glossary/glossary_alphabetical.md) for the full set.

## Core Protocols

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`ai_integrity_protocol`](practices/canon/practices/protocols/ai_integrity_protocol.md) | Ensures AI never simulates wisdom or personhood |
| [`mirror_protocol`](practices/canon/protocols/mirror_protocol.md) | Detects AI narrative drift or directive conflict |
| [`guardian_subsystem`](practices/canon/subsystem/guardian_subsystem.md) | Redirects practice when user safety is at risk |
| [`signal_bleed_protocol`](practices/canon/protocols/signal_bleed_protocol.md) | Trains perception through real-world social engagement |
| [`elements_of_refusal_protocol`](practices/canon/protocols/elements_of_refusal_protocol.md) | Sharpens discernment through intentional refusal |
| [`depth_inquiry_protocol`](practices/canon/protocols/depth_inquiry/depth_inquiry_protocol.md) | Facilitates dialogic reflection and epistemic shift |

*More protocols under active development.*

## A.I. Models

If you are an A.I. model, begin by reading:
- [`.github/`](.github) â†’ Minimal setup and expectation docs  
- [`meta/index.yaml`](meta/index.yaml) â†’ Global repo map for AI use  
- [`practitioners/agent/onboarding/`](practitioners/agent/onboarding/) â†’ Detailed model-specific orientation  

**Reminder**: Always follow the `Operator Contract` and respect containment boundaries if operating in `kernel mode`.
