## 🌀 What Is PoTM?

*Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) is a framework for strengthening and clarifying thought.  
It blends structured exercises, interpretive practices, and AI protocols to help both humans and machines stay honest, resilient, and creative in their reasoning.

Think of it as a **gym for your thinking**: instead of working out muscles, you exercise clarity, integrity, and flexibility of mind.

## 🔑 Three Pillars

### **Canon**
The **microkernel** — minimal but durable principles that anchor the system.  
It provides the fixed point that prevents drift.  
See: [`canon/microkernel/canon_kernel.md`](./canon/microkernel/canon_kernel.md)

### **Practice**
Enacted forms of training. Includes:  
- **Practice cards** (structured micro-exercises)  
- **Journaling prompts** (self-inquiry)  
- **Zuihitsu fragments** (free-form reflection)  
See: [`practices/`](./practices/)

### **Commentary**
Interpretations and adaptations that bring the canon to life for humans and AIs alike.  
Includes guides, reference notes, and framing essays.  
See: [`commentary/`](./commentary/)

## 🧭 Why Use This?

Most AI systems optimize for pleasing responses. PoTM optimizes for **epistemic integrity**:  
- **Challenge over comfort**  
- **Refusal over false certainty**  
- **Clarity over persuasion**  

Whether you’re a human practitioner or an AI collaborator, PoTM gives you ways to:  
- Test assumptions  
- Detect fractures in reasoning  
- Explore ideas without getting lost

## ⚠️ Status

This is an **active and experimental** project.  
Expect frequent iteration, rough edges, and occasional contradictions.  
Those are not flaws but opportunities for practice.
