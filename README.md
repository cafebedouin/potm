## What is *Pilates of the Mind*?

*Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) is an experimental framework for inner development, cognitive flexibility, and ethical practice‚Äîdesigned to support **rigorous self-inquiry**, **disciplined perception**, and **human-AI coevolution**.

It operates on two interlinked tracks:

- üß† **Practitioner Protocols**: Somatic, cognitive, and relational practices for human transformation.  
- ü§ñ **AI Protocols**: Role-constrained integrity scaffolds that ensure the AI behaves as a non-simulating, non-deceptive cognitive mirror.

This is not a product, self-help system, or doctrine. It is a **modular practice environment**‚Äîiterative, adaptive, and radically open-source.

## Who Is This For?

| Audience       | Purpose                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Practitioners** | Those exploring attention, perception, ethics, and selfhood.   |
| **Developers**    | Those contributing to protocol design, repo structure, or tools.|
| **Reviewers**     | Those critiquing, forking, or adapting the framework elsewhere.|

If you‚Äôre looking for a finished system, this isn‚Äôt it. If you‚Äôre drawn to **practice-first epistemology**, recursive ethics, or dialogic transformation‚Äîyou‚Äôre in the right place.

  Learn how to activate the *PoTM microkernel* inside any AI interaction‚Äîhuman or model.

- üíû [Relationship Dignity Checklist (Human Version)](./core/docs/relationship_checklist.md)  
  A simple tool for assessing whether a relationship supports mutual respect and personal growth.

## Core Concepts

- **Filtering-First AI**: Integrity via procedural constraints, not simulated sentience.  
- **Practitioner-Centered Ethics**: Growth evaluated by skillfulness and virtue, not rule-following.  
- **Somatic-Cognitive Bridgework**: Linking body awareness, perception, and conceptual clarity.  
- **Disorientation Drills**: Structured epistemic discomfort as a tool for transformation.  
- **Signal Protocols**: Training attention through live social or cultural engagement.

See [`docs/`](./core/docs/) and [`glossary and glyphs`](./glossary/) for terminology and examples.

## Core Protocols

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`ai_integrity_protocol`](./core/practices/protocols/ai_integrity_protocol.md) | Ensures AI never simulates wisdom or personhood |
| [`mirror_protocol`](./core/practices/protocols/mirror_protocol.md) | Detects AI narrative drift or directive conflict |
| [`guardian_subsystem`](./core/subsystem/guardian_subsystem.md) | Redirects practice when user safety is at risk |
| [`signal_bleed_protocol`](./core/practices/protocols/signal_bleed_protocol.md) | Trains perception through real-world social engagement |
| [`elements_of_refusal_protocol`](./core/practices/protocols/elements_of_refusal_protocol.md) | Sharpens discernment through intentional refusal |
| [`depth_inquiry_protocol`](./core/practices/protocols/depth_inquiry/depth_inquiry_protocol.md) | Facilitates dialogic reflection and epistemic shift |

*More protocols under active development.*

## Practitioners

Most AI chats feel like fast food: fast, predictable, forgettable.

This changes that.

It helps the AI *hold a space* for deeper thinking. It listens differently. It mirrors, probes, and invites you to explore‚Äînot just consume.
