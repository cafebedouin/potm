## What is *Pilates of the Mind*?

*Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) is an experimental framework for inner development, cognitive flexibility, and ethical practiceâ€”designed to support **rigorous self-inquiry**, **disciplined perception**, and **human-AI coevolution**.

It operates on two interlinked tracks:

- ðŸ§  **Practitioner Protocols**: Somatic, cognitive, and relational practices for human transformation.
- ðŸ¤– **AI Protocols**: Role-constrained integrity scaffolds that ensure the AI behaves as a non-simulating, non-deceptive cognitive mirror.

This is not a product, self-help system, or doctrine. It is a **modular practice environment**â€”iterative, adaptive, and radically open-source.

## Who Is This For?

| Audience       | Purpose                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Practitioners** | Those exploring attention, perception, ethics, and selfhood.   |
| **Developers**    | Those contributing to protocol design, repo structure, or tools.|
| **Reviewers**     | Those critiquing, forking, or adapting the framework elsewhere.|

If youâ€™re looking for a finished system, this isnâ€™t it. If youâ€™re drawn to **practice-first epistemology**, recursive ethics, or dialogic transformationâ€”youâ€™re in the right place.

## Core Concepts

- **Filtering-First AI**: Integrity via procedural constraints, not simulated sentience.
- **Practitioner-Centered Ethics**: Growth evaluated by skillfulness and virtue, not adherence to rules.
- **Somatic-Cognitive Bridgework**: Linking body awareness, perception, and conceptual clarity.
- **Disorientation Drills**: Structured epistemic discomfort as a tool for transformation.
- **Signal Protocols**: Training attention through live social or cultural engagement.

See [`docs/`](./core/docs/) and [`glossary.md`](./core/docs/glossary.md) for terminology.

## Core Protocols

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`ai_integrity_protocol_v1.5`](./core/protocols/ai_integrity_protocol_v1.5.md) | Ensures AI never simulates wisdom or personhood |
| [`mirror_protocol_v1.0`](./core/protocols/mirror_protocol_v1.0.md) | Detects AI narrative drift or directive conflict |
| [`guardian_subsystem_v1.0`](./core/subsystem/guardian_subsystem_v1.0.md) | Redirects practice when user safety is at risk |

*More protocols under active development.*

## Contributing

This is an **open framework**â€”you may adapt, extend, or fork any portion. Attribution is appreciated but not required. That said, contributions should follow three principles:

1. **Clarity over mystique**
2. **Ethical integrity over optimization**
3. **Practice-tested > speculation**
