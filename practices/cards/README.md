# 🃏 Cards Practice README

## Overview
Practice cards are **micro-practices**: short, focused exercises designed to shift perspective, regulate state, or spark insight.  
Each card can be completed in **2–15 minutes**. Cards may be drawn at random, chosen by intent, or scheduled into a routine.

---

## Current Card Families
- **Somatic Cards** 🫁 — body awareness, breathing, posture, tension release  
- **Reflection Cards** 🪞 — self-inquiry prompts, lenses, perspective shifts  
- **Action Cards** 🎬 — small behavioral experiments, habit nudges  
- **Creative Cards** 🎨 — imagination drills, constraints, playful disruption  

---

## How to Use
- **Random Draw** → shuffle the deck and let chance decide  
- **Intentional Selection** → choose by tag or family (somatic, reflection, action, creative)  
- **Scheduled Practice** → integrate 1–3 cards into daily rhythm  
- **Responsive Use** → pick a card that matches your current state (fog, tension, stuckness, etc.)  

---

## Complementary Practices
These expand the cards approach into **check-in style practices** aligned with the *Finding Your Best Starting Point* guide:

- **Body Check-ins** 🏃 — weekly PT tests, weight/waist logs, sleep notes  
- **Emotion Tracking** 💓 — daily mood rating, “name 3 feelings”  
- **Mind Clarity** 🧠 — fog/focus slider, quick cognitive load check  
- **Relationship Pulse** 🤝 — short checklist on connection quality  

---

## Orientation Guides
Cards are part of a larger system. See also:

- 🌍 [Finding Your Best Starting Point](../../practitioners/human/guides/finding_best_starting_point.md) — entry logic for choosing practices  
- 🗺️ [Preventive Atlas](../../meta/preventive_atlas.md) — seasonal review of silent-drift domains  

---

## Feedback Loops
- Journal prompts can emerge from card reflections  
- Somatic cards prepare for meditation or roleplay  
- Recurring themes flagged from cards can inform Atlas review  

---

## Temporal Rhythm
- **Daily**: draw or choose 1–3 cards  
- **Weekly**: run a body/emotion/mind/relationship check-in  
- **Seasonal**: review broader life domains with the Preventive Atlas

### Lineage
- **Forge origin**: Integration design for practice layer coherence  
- **Spiral evaluation**: Draft refined via Pal review for repo readiness
