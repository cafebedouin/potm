# 💵 Financial Resilience Check

**Purpose:**  
Financial drift creates stress in every domain — health, relationships, mental state. This check reviews whether you can withstand shocks and maintain security.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Emergency fund:** Do I have 3–6 months of essential expenses saved?  
- [ ] **Debt load:** Am I carrying manageable or unmanageable debt?  
- [ ] **Cash flow:** Do I spend less than I earn most months?  
- [ ] **Insurance:** Is core coverage (health, home/renters, auto, life if dependents) up to date?  
- [ ] **Stress test:** Could I cover one unexpected $1,000 expense without debt?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Savings rate:** Am I regularly saving (even small amounts)?  
- **Liquidity:** How quickly can I access cash if needed?  
- **Income sources:** Am I reliant on a single income stream?  
- **Contingency planning:** Do I have a plan for job loss, illness, or economic downturn?  
- **Dependents:** Are my family/partners covered if I’m suddenly unable to provide?
