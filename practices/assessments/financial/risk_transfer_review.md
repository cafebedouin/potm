# 🛡️ Risk Transfer Review (Insurance)

**Purpose:**  
Insurance shifts catastrophic risk off your personal ledger. This review ensures coverage still fits your life circumstances.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Health insurance:** Do I have active coverage that meets my current needs?  
- [ ] **Home / renters insurance:** Is my residence and belongings covered adequately?  
- [ ] **Auto insurance:** Is coverage current and at least at legal minimums?  
- [ ] **Life insurance:** If I have dependents, is protection sufficient?  
- [ ] **Disability insurance:** Would I have income if illness/injury prevented work?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Coverage levels:** Do my limits reflect current assets and risks?  
- **Beneficiaries:** Are beneficiary designations up to date?  
- **Policy changes:** Has my provider adjusted terms, costs, or exclusions?  
- **Gaps:** Any uncovered areas (e.g., dental, vision, travel, cyber, liability)?  
- **Shopping around:** Would switching providers lower cost or increase benefits?
