# 📈 Investment Review

**Purpose:**  
Investments silently drift through market changes, fees, and neglect. Regular review keeps savings aligned with goals and risk tolerance.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Retirement contributions:** Am I contributing at least enough to get employer match (if offered)?  
- [ ] **Portfolio balance:** Are my assets aligned with my risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, cash, alternatives)?  
- [ ] **Performance:** Did my accounts grow in line with benchmarks?  
- [ ] **Fees:** Are management or fund fees under control?  
- [ ] **Net worth:** Has my overall financial position improved this quarter?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Rebalancing:** Has my portfolio drifted from target allocations?  
- **Tax efficiency:** Am I using tax-advantaged accounts effectively (IRA, 401k, HSA)?  
- **Liquidity:** Do I have accessible funds outside retirement accounts?  
- **Long-term goals:** Am I on track for retirement, education, or other savings plans?  
- **Risk exposure:** Do I understand major risks (market downturn, concentration in one sector, crypto, real estate)?
