# 📊 Budget Monthly Scan

**Purpose:**  
Money drift happens silently — subscriptions stack, impulse purchases pile up, and spending disconnects from values. This scan brings monthly clarity and control.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Income vs. expenses:** Did I spend less than I earned this month?  
- [ ] **Tracking:** Do I know where most of my money went?  
- [ ] **Alignment:** Did spending reflect my top 2–3 priorities?  
- [ ] **Red flags:** Any late fees, overdrafts, or “surprise” bills?  
- [ ] **Adjustments:** Do I need to shift categories for next month?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Subscriptions:** Did I pay for anything I no longer use?  
- **Impulse spending:** What % of spending was unplanned?  
- **Stress purchases:** Did I buy things to soothe stress or boredom?  
- **Giving/sharing:** Did I contribute to causes, community, or relationships as intended?  
- **Savings transfer:** Did I actually move money into savings/investments this month?
