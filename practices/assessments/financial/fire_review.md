# 🔥 FIRE Review

**Purpose:**  
FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) uses a simple formula:  
**Annual Spending × Safe Withdrawal Rate = Required Savings.**  
This review checks how close you are to financial independence by indexing against both *minimum* and *average* household income benchmarks.

## ✅ Reference Numbers (2025)

- **Poverty line (U.S., household of 3):** $21,150  
- **Average household family income:** $62,192  

**At 3% withdrawal rate (conservative):**
- Poverty line: ~$705,000 savings  
- Average income: ~$2.07 million savings  

**At 4% withdrawal rate (classic FIRE rule):**
- Poverty line: ~$529,000 savings  
- Average income: ~$1.55 million savings  

*(3% = higher safety margin; 4% = historically sustainable with typical market returns, especially if partial income continues post-FI.)*

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Annual spending baseline:** Do I know my actual yearly expenses?  
- [ ] **Savings total:** What is my current investable net worth?  
- [ ] **FIRE multiple:** How many years of expenses have I saved (25× for 4%, 33× for 3%)?  
- [ ] **Target range:** Am I closer to the poverty-indexed number or the average-income benchmark?  
- [ ] **Optionality:** Could part-time or side income reduce the total required?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Withdrawal rate choice:** Does 3% or 4% better match my risk tolerance?  
- **Geography:** Would cost of living changes shift my FIRE number up or down?  
- **Flexibility:** Could I cut spending during downturns?  
- **Health care:** Is coverage planned for (often a hidden FIRE cost)?  
- **Philosophy:** Do I want lean FIRE (minimum) or fat FIRE (comfort/luxury)?
