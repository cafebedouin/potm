# 🗳️ Civic Engagement Checklist

**Purpose:**  
Communities thrive when members participate. This checklist reviews your role in civic life — making sure you’re connected, represented, and contributing.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Voting:** Am I registered, and did I vote in the most recent elections?  
- [ ] **Representation:** Do I know who represents me locally and nationally?  
- [ ] **Voice:** Have I contacted a representative, signed a petition, or spoken up on an issue this year?  
- [ ] **Community meetings:** Have I attended a town hall, school board, or local forum?  
- [ ] **Commons:** Have I contributed time, skills, or resources to public goods (parks, libraries, neighborhood efforts)?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Knowledge:** Do I understand the main issues affecting my local area?  
- **Balance:** Am I engaging in ways that strengthen community, not just venting online?  
- **Networks:** Am I connected to at least one civic or advocacy group?  
- **Impact:** Do I feel my actions contribute to change, however small?  
- **Sustainability:** Am I engaging at a pace I can sustain without burnout?
