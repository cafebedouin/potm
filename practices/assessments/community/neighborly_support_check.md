# 🏘️ Neighborly Support Check

**Purpose:**  
Strong communities start close to home. This check looks at whether you and your neighbors (or local circle) can rely on one another for everyday support and emergencies.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Know names:** Do I know the names of my immediate neighbors or closest circle?  
- [ ] **Casual trust:** Do we greet, share news, or look out for each other?  
- [ ] **Practical help:** Could I borrow a tool, get a ride, or watch a pet for someone nearby?  
- [ ] **Emergency support:** Could I rely on at least one neighbor if something urgent happened?  
- [ ] **Reciprocity:** Am I offering as much support as I hope to receive?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Frequency:** How often do I interact with neighbors outside of necessity?  
- **Celebration:** Do we share food, holidays, or milestones together?  
- **Conflict:** Are disputes handled respectfully, or left to fester?  
- **Networks:** Do I belong to any neighborhood groups, chats, or associations?  
- **Preparedness:** If disaster struck, would my local network be a strength or a weakness?
