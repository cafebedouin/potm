# 🌐 Community Resonance Scan

**Purpose:**  
Communities shape what feels normal. This scan checks whether your community culture resonates with your dignity, values, and growth — or erodes them.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Trust:** Do people here generally keep promises and act with integrity?  
- [ ] **Belonging:** Do I feel included and valued, not invisible or excluded?  
- [ ] **Support:** Can I ask for help without shame or penalty?  
- [ ] **Dialogue:** Are different opinions allowed, or punished?  
- [ ] **Energy:** Does being part of this community leave me energized or drained?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Role models:** Are there people here I admire and want to emulate?  
- **Conflict:** How are disagreements handled — with respect, avoidance, or aggression?  
- **Openness:** Does the community welcome newcomers, or close ranks?  
- **Health:** Do people thrive here, or burn out and leave?  
- **Alignment:** Does this community support the beacons I’m moving toward (growth crossover)?
