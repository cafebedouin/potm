# 🛡️ Integrity & Dignity Anchors Check

**Purpose:**  
Values have two faces: aspirational (beacons to grow toward) and protective (boundaries that preserve dignity). This check focuses on the protective side — clarifying what must never be crossed without harm to self or others.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Boundaries:** Do I know which behaviors I will not tolerate (disrespect, dishonesty, coercion)?  
- [ ] **Self-respect:** Have I acted in ways consistent with my dignity this quarter?  
- [ ] **Community respect:** Do I protect others’ dignity as strongly as my own?  
- [ ] **Enforcement:** When boundaries were tested, did I enforce them?  
- [ ] **Erosion:** Have I let small compromises slide that weaken integrity?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Red lines:** What is absolutely non-negotiable in relationships, work, and self-care?  
- **Test points:** Where did I feel pressure to betray myself? Did I resist or yield?  
- **Respect received:** Who consistently honors my boundaries and dignity?  
- **Respect given:** How did I show dignity toward others, especially under stress?  
- **Repair:** If I compromised integrity, what action is needed to restore it?
