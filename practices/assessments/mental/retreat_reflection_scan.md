# 🧘 Retreat Reflection Scan

**Purpose:**  
Retreats (whether a day, weekend, or longer) provide space to step back from daily noise. This scan helps ensure the time is used to renew integrity, restore dignity, and clarify direction.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Rest:** Did I allow myself full disconnection from routine demands?  
- [ ] **Integrity:** Did I revisit whether I’m living according to my core anchors?  
- [ ] **Dignity:** Did I reflect on whether I’ve been honoring others’ dignity as well as my own?  
- [ ] **Release:** Did I let go of at least one unresolved weight?  
- [ ] **Re-entry:** Do I have one clear takeaway to carry back into daily life?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Body check:** What signals has my body been sending that I’ve ignored?  
- **Emotional honesty:** What feelings have I been suppressing that surfaced here?  
- **Boundaries:** Where am I overextended, and what needs to be withdrawn?  
- **Aspirations:** Which beacon values feel most alive now (growth crossover)?  
- **Next season:** What is one shift I want to experiment with over the next 3–6 months?
