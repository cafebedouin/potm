# 📝 Unresolved Issues Journal

**Purpose:**  
Some problems fade if left alone; others circle back until addressed. This journal helps track unresolved issues so they don’t silently erode dignity, energy, or relationships.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Recurrence:** Is there a thought, memory, or situation that keeps resurfacing?  
- [ ] **Weight:** Does it drain my energy when it comes up?  
- [ ] **Integrity:** Does avoiding it make me feel less authentic?  
- [ ] **Relationships:** Does it strain how I relate to others?  
- [ ] **Action:** Do I know what would resolve or release it?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Pattern:** What themes recur in my unresolved issues (betrayal, fear, regret, debt)?  
- **Ownership:** Which parts are mine to resolve, and which belong to others?  
- **Voice:** If the issue could speak, what would it ask of me?  
- **Boundary vs. repair:** Does this require drawing a line, or building a bridge?  
- **Next step:** What small action could move me closer to closure?
