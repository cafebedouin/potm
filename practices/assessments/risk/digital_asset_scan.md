# 🗄️ Digital Estate Scan

**Purpose:**  
We leave behind digital as well as physical assets. A digital estate scan ensures accounts, passwords, and key files won’t lock up or vanish if something happens to you.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Password manager:** Do I use one, and does a trusted person know how to access it?  
- [ ] **Key accounts:** Are instructions documented for email, banking, utilities, and social media?  
- [ ] **Digital assets:** Have I listed valuable files, crypto, domains, or online businesses?  
- [ ] **Legal links:** Do my will/trust reference digital assets?  
- [ ] **Access continuity:** Is at least one trusted contact prepared to act if needed?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Redundancy:** Are backups of critical files both local and cloud-based?  
- **Social presence:** Do I want accounts memorialized, deleted, or handed over?  
- **Subscriptions:** What recurring digital payments need canceling?  
- **Creative work:** Is writing, media, or code preserved in an accessible format?  
- **Ethics:** Have I clarified what should remain private vs. shared?
