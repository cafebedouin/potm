# ⚠️ Personal Risk Map

**Purpose:**  
Risks compound when ignored. A risk map brings scattered concerns into one view, so you can plan mitigations before crisis hits.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Health:** Am I at risk for untreated conditions, burnout, or accidents?  
- [ ] **Financial:** Could a job loss, debt, or market downturn destabilize me?  
- [ ] **Relational:** Am I reliant on fragile or unhealthy ties for core needs?  
- [ ] **Environment:** Do I live in a region vulnerable to disaster, crime, or instability?  
- [ ] **Digital:** Could data loss, theft, or reputation harm hit me suddenly?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Likelihood vs. impact:** Which risks are unlikely but catastrophic, vs. frequent but manageable?  
- **Dependencies:** Who or what am I most reliant on?  
- **Early warning:** What signs would tell me risk is increasing?  
- **Mitigation:** What practical steps reduce each risk’s impact?  
- **Recovery:** Do I have a plan if mitigation fails?
