# 🚨 Emergency Plan Review

**Purpose:**  
Emergencies can’t be predicted, but preparation changes outcomes. This review ensures your household has the basics covered for safety and continuity.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Contacts:** Do I have updated emergency contacts (family, neighbors, services)?  
- [ ] **Communication:** Do household members know how to reach each other if phones fail?  
- [ ] **Supplies:** Do I have at least 3 days of food, water, and medications?  
- [ ] **Power:** Do I have flashlights, batteries, chargers, or a backup source?  
- [ ] **Evacuation:** Do I know exit routes and have a go-bag ready?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Medical:** Are first aid kits stocked and accessible?  
- **Household roles:** Does each member know their role (grab supplies, secure pets, etc.)?  
- **Local risks:** Am I prepared for region-specific hazards (storm, fire, quake)?  
- **Financial continuity:** Do I have cash on hand and key documents stored safely?  
- **Rehearsal:** Have we walked through the plan in the last year?
