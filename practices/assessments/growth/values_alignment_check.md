# 🌱 Values Alignment Check (Directional Growth)

**Purpose:**  
Growth isn’t just about acquiring skills — it’s about **moving toward what matters**. This check frames values as **beacons**: guiding where to invest energy and which paths to prioritize.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Beacon clarity:** Can I name the top 2–3 values shaping my growth today?  
- [ ] **Path match:** Do my current projects or career steps reflect those values?  
- [ ] **Phase fit:** Am I leaning toward technical mastery, managerial leadership, independence, or another path that expresses those values?  
- [ ] **Energy alignment:** Do I feel energized by my direction, or drained by misfit?  
- [ ] **Adjustment:** Do I need to pivot toward a new beacon?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Technical beacon:** Am I moving deeper into craft, problem-solving, and mastery?  
- **Managerial beacon:** Am I building systems, culture, and team stewardship?  
- **Independent beacon:** Am I creating autonomy through entrepreneurship or self-direction?  
- **Contribution beacon:** Am I focusing on service, teaching, or legacy-building?  
- **Shift over time:** Which values guided me 5 years ago, and which guide me now?
