# 🤝 Mentoring Review

**Purpose:**  
Mentorship is a two-way practice. Early on, you need mentors; later, you’re expected to mentor others. In mid-career, both flow together. This review helps you see whether you’re receiving and giving the guidance needed for growth.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Receiving:** Do I have at least one trusted mentor for my current stage?  
- [ ] **Giving:** Am I mentoring or teaching someone else regularly?  
- [ ] **Balance:** Does the balance between receiving and giving match my career phase?  
- [ ] **Fit:** Are my mentors aligned with my chosen path (technical, managerial, or hybrid)?  
- [ ] **Impact:** Do I notice tangible growth — in myself or those I guide?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Early-career (0–5 yrs):** Do I have access to senior guides who open doors and prevent mistakes?  
- **Mid-career (5–15 yrs):** Am I both learning from above and mentoring below?  
- **Late-career (15+ yrs):** Am I developing talent pipelines, teaching systems, or leaving legacies?  
- **Diversity of input:** Do my mentors bring different perspectives (inside/outside org, technical/relational)?  
- **Path choice:** Is my mentoring network helping me explore technical mastery vs. leadership/management?
