# 🗺️ Career Futures Map

**Purpose:**  
Career landscapes shift faster than we expect. A futures map helps clarify primary, secondary, and backup paths — keeping options alive if circumstances change.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Primary path:** Do I see at least 2–3 years of runway in my current work?  
- [ ] **Secondary path:** Could I pivot to a related role with existing skills?  
- [ ] **Backup path:** Do I have a fallback plan if primary and secondary collapse?  
- [ ] **Market shifts:** Am I aware of trends that could disrupt my field?  
- [ ] **Identity:** Would losing my current role erase my sense of worth?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Skills match:** Are my strongest skills portable to new industries or contexts?  
- **Emerging trends:** What signals suggest growth opportunities in adjacent fields?  
- **Risk clusters:** Am I over-dependent on a single employer, industry, or geography?  
- **Experiments:** Have I tested side projects, freelancing, or alternative income?  
- **Meaning:** Does my envisioned path align with my deeper values and desired impact?
