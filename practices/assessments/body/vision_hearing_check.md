# 👁️👂 Vision & Hearing Check

**Purpose:**  
Eyes and ears drift silently — changes are gradual and easy to miss. Regular checks protect safety, learning, and connection.

---

## ✅ Quick Self-Check

- [ ] **Vision:** Any difficulty reading, driving at night, or screen strain?  
- [ ] **Hearing:** Do you turn up volume, miss words in conversation, or feel ringing (tinnitus)?  
- [ ] **Daily function:** Are glasses/contact prescriptions or hearing aids current?  
- [ ] **Environment:** Do I protect against loud noise or screen glare?
