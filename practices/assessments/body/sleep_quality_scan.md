# 😴 Sleep Quality Scan

**Purpose:**  
Sleep drift often sneaks up slowly. This scan helps track whether your rest is truly restorative — not just long enough, but deep enough.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Duration:** Am I getting 7–9 hours most nights?  
- [ ] **Consistency:** Do I fall asleep and wake up around the same times?  
- [ ] **Interruptions:** Do I wake up often or sleep through the night?  
- [ ] **Restoration:** Do I feel refreshed after waking?  
- [ ] **Daytime alertness:** Do I need caffeine/naps to stay functional?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Dream recall:** Am I remembering dreams (sign of deeper sleep phases)?  
- **Snoring / breathing:** Any disruptions noticed by me or a partner?  
- **Sleep environment:** Is my bedroom dark, cool, and quiet?  
- **Evening routine:** Am I on screens late or winding down effectively?  
- **Morning rhythm:** Do I wake with energy or grogginess?
