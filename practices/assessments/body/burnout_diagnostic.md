# 🔥 Burnout Diagnostic

**Purpose:**  
Burnout builds slowly — small signals accumulate until energy collapses. This diagnostic highlights early warning signs in body, emotions, and behavior.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Exhaustion:** Do I feel drained most days, even after rest?  
- [ ] **Sleep:** Am I restless at night or waking up tired?  
- [ ] **Mood:** Am I more irritable, withdrawn, or numb than usual?  
- [ ] **Focus:** Is it harder to concentrate or make decisions?  
- [ ] **Motivation:** Do previously meaningful tasks feel like a burden?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Body signals:** Frequent headaches, tension, digestive issues, or illness?  
- **Emotional state:** Do small problems feel overwhelming?  
- **Cynicism:** Am I growing negative toward work, people, or commitments?  
- **Performance drift:** Are mistakes increasing or deadlines harder to meet?  
- **Support:** Am I isolating instead of reaching for help?
