# 🏋️ Physical Training Standards (Baseline Strength & Fitness)

**Purpose:**  
To give ordinary practitioners a clear target for balanced strength, cardio, and mobility — not elite military or sport standards, but functional baselines for resilience and health.

---

## ✅ Strength (Barbell, if available)

- **Deadlift:** 405 lbs (men) / 225–275 lbs (women)  
- **Squat:** 315 lbs (men) / 185–225 lbs (women)  
- **Bench Press:** 225 lbs (men) / 115–135 lbs (women)  
- **Overhead Press:** 135 lbs (men) / 65–85 lbs (women)  

*(If no barbell: substitute with weighted carries, loaded pack squats, or resistance bands.)*

---

## 🏃 Endurance

- **1.5 mile run:** ≤ 15:00 (baseline)  
- **Stretch goal:** ≤ 12:00  

---

## 🤸 Calisthenics

- **Push-ups:** 30 (men) / 15 (women)  
- **Pull-ups:** 8 (men) / 3 (women)  
- **Leg raises:** 20 controlled reps  

---

## 🧘 Mobility

- **Sit-and-reach:** Toes or 2–4" past  
- **Overhead reach:** Arms overhead without lumbar arch

👉 Would you like me to **slot this into the Body index block** right after *Weight & Waist Check*, or keep it as an “optional” file for now (since it requires equipment access for full version)?
