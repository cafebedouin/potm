# 🩺 Body Checklist

**Purpose:**  
Catch subtle changes in health and energy before they grow into bigger problems. Use this quarterly or whenever you feel “off.”

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Energy:** Do I feel rested most mornings?  
- [ ] **Sleep:** Am I averaging 7–9 hours with minimal interruption?  
- [ ] **Movement:** Am I active enough that my body feels engaged (not stiff or sluggish)?  
- [ ] **Stress signals:** Am I noticing frequent headaches, stomach tension, or jaw clenching?  
- [ ] **Breath:** Can I take a slow, full breath without effort?

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Appetite & digestion:** Any shifts in hunger, weight, or digestion?  
- **Injury & pain:** Any aches or recurring injuries that haven’t been checked?  
- **Skin, hair, nails:** Any unusual changes (rash, thinning, brittleness)?  
- **Circulation:** Any numbness, tingling, or cold extremities?  
- **Vital signs:** When did I last check blood pressure, pulse, or routine labs?
