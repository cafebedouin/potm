# ⚖️ Weight & Waist Check

**Purpose:**  
Numbers aren’t destiny, but they do show trends. Measuring waist and weight helps catch silent drift in body composition before it turns into health problems.

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Height:** Record once (for baseline).  
- [ ] **Weight:** Weigh yourself under consistent conditions (same time of day, similar clothing).  
- [ ] **Waist circumference:** Measure at the narrowest point between ribs and hips, or level with the navel.

## 📊 Interpreting Results

**Waist circumference (general health cut-offs):**
- Men:  
  - < 94 cm (37 in): Low risk  
  - 94–102 cm (37–40 in): Moderate risk  
  - > 102 cm (40 in): High risk  
- Women:  
  - < 80 cm (31.5 in): Low risk  
  - 80–88 cm (31.5–35 in): Moderate risk  
  - > 88 cm (35 in): High risk  

**Body Mass Index (BMI):**
- Calculate: `BMI = weight (kg) ÷ [height (m)]²`  
- Categories (WHO):  
  - < 18.5 = Underweight  
  - 18.5–24.9 = Normal  
  - 25–29.9 = Overweight  
  - ≥ 30 = Obese  

*(BMI has limits — especially for muscular or older bodies — but tracking trends is still useful.)*
