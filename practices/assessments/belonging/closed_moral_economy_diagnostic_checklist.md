# ⚖️ Closed Moral Economy Diagnostic Matrix

A practical tool for assessing how tightly a group enforces belonging, how costly exit is, and whether dynamics are softening or hardening over time.

---

## 🌱 Orienting Question

**“How closed is this community, and what are the risks or freedoms of belonging here?”**

---

## 🧮 Step 1. Core Axes (Rate Each 1–5)

| Axis                | 1 = Soft Closure             | 3 = Medium Closure               | 5 = Hard/Extreme Closure         |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Exit Cost**       | Easy to leave, little stigma | Some stigma, gossip, loss of ties | Severe loss: livelihood, family, identity |
| **Pariah Logic**    | Teasing, mild exclusion      | Reputation damage, gossip, shunning | Traitor/apostate framing, threats, violence |
| **Identity Fusion** | “I do this” (interest)       | “I am this” (identity marker)     | “Without this, I don’t exist” (existential) |
| **Authority**       | Loose, leaderless            | Local leaders/gatekeepers        | Singular or absolute authority   |
| **Resource Control**| No material dependence       | Some resources tied to group     | Survival resources (housing, jobs, healthcare) |
| **Threat Narrative**| Benign, hobbyist             | Some ridicule/opposition         | Siege mentality, “life or death” |

---

## 📊 Step 2. Drift Predictors

- **Hardening Indicators**  
  - Siege language rising (“they’re coming for us”)  
  - Leader consolidates authority  
  - Exiters framed as traitors or contaminants  
  - Resources tied more tightly to membership  

- **Softening Indicators**  
  - Growth or institutional scaling  
  - Members hold multiple identities comfortably  
  - Belonging reframed as choice, not essence  
  - Outsider acceptance increases  

---

## 🧾 Step 3. Score & Interpret

- **6–12 points → Soft Closure**  
  Low stakes, playful enforcement. Fandoms, hobby groups.  

- **13–20 points → Medium Closure**  
  Social penalties, gossip, reputation loss. Poly networks, academic fields.  

- **21–30 points → Hard Closure**  
  Exit = identity/livelihood loss. Traitormarking common. Small towns, MAGA, military.  

- **31+ points → Extreme Closure**  
  Exit = existential danger. Cults, revolutionary cells, totalitarian movements.  

---

## 🧭 Usage

- **Seasonal Review:** Use the matrix periodically to track group drift.  
- **Joining Aid:** Apply before committing to a new group.  
- **Boundary Signal:** If scores cluster in Hard/Extreme, consult the *Scope Boundaries* section of the **Advanced Practitioner Guide**.

### 🔎 Scope Note
This diagnostic is designed for everyday reflection on groups and communities.  

If your scoring reveals **high-control dynamics** with existential exit costs or threats, this may be a **boundary signal** that the situation is beyond PoTM’s intended scope.  

📌 In such cases, consult the *Scope Boundaries* section of the **Advanced Practitioner Guide** for appropriate next steps and external resources.
