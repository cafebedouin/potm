# üå± Belonging Assessments

These tools help you reflect on how your relationships, communities, and practices support or constrain your growth. They range from simple self-checks to more advanced diagnostics.  

Start simple, follow curiosity, and use only what feels useful.

## üíû Relational Tools

- [Relationship Checklist](relationship_checklist.md)  
  Quick scan of relational health. Seven core questions to notice if a relationship feels respectful, supportive, and growth-oriented.  

- [Relational Zones Gradient](relational_zones_gradient.md)  
  The underpinning continuum of relational dynamics ‚Äî from **Toxic** to **Messy** to **Generative**. A way to name what zone you‚Äôre in.  

- [Relational Dignity Filter](relational_dignity_filter.md)  
  A safety gate for dialogue integrity. Helps you recognize when conversation is no longer viable and when to pause or exit.

## üåê Community & Ecology Tools

- [Community Checklist](community_checklist.md)  
  Scan whether a group supports freedom and belonging or enforces conformity and exclusion.  

- [Closed Moral Economy Diagnostic Matrix](closed_moral_economy_diagnostic_matrix.md)  
  Formal assessment of group closure, exit cost, and pariah logic. Useful for mapping how ‚Äúhard‚Äù or ‚Äúsoft‚Äù a community is.  

- [Place Checklist](place_checklist.md)  
  Looks at your town, city, or region as an **ecology of communities**. How much choice and freedom does this place give you?  

- [Ideas Checklist](ideas_checklist.md)  
  Reflection on the belief systems and frameworks you live by. Are they helping you grow, or keeping you stuck?  

- [Practice Ecology Scan](practice_ecology_scan.md)  
  Reviews daily actions and habits ‚Äî how they interlock to create (or erode) the ecology you need.

## üåÄ Advanced Diagnostics

For practitioners with more experience or complex contexts:  

- [Relation Zone Multi-Level Diagnostic](relation_zone_multi_level.md)  
  Extends the relational zones to **dyad, community, and meta-community** scales. Helps decide when to repair, exit, or adapt in place.

### üîé Scope Note
These tools are designed for everyday reflection and growth.  

If your answers reveal **control, coercion, or high-risk dynamics**, this may be a **boundary signal** that the situation is beyond PoTM‚Äôs intended scope.  

üìå In such cases, consult the *Scope Boundaries* section of the **Advanced Practitioner Guide** for appropriate next steps and external resources.
