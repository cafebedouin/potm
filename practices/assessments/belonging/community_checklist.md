### 🌱 Orienting Question

At the heart of this checklist lies a simple but powerful inquiry:

**“Am I with the right people, practicing the right ideas, for the life I want to grow?”**

This tool applies the question to collective belonging: groups, networks, and shared cultures.

# 🌐 Community Participation Checklist

## 1. Belonging
- Do I feel recognized and accepted in this group?  
- Is my participation voluntary, or do I feel pressure to conform?  
- Am I free to express dissent without fear of exile?  

## 2. Exit Cost
- If I stepped back tomorrow, what would I actually lose (friends, livelihood, identity)?  
- Does the group frame leaving as betrayal, or as a normal choice?  

## 3. Pariah Logic
- How does this group treat people who leave or break norms?  
- Is there room for mistakes and repair, or only punishment and exclusion?  

## 4. Authority & Resources
- Who holds power here, and how accountable are they?  
- Does the group control my survival resources (housing, income, medical, family ties)?  
- Can I say “no” safely to authority figures inside the group?  

## 5. Threat Narrative
- Does the group see outsiders as benign, rivals, or enemies?  
- Is belonging framed as “fun,” “family,” or “life or death”?  
- Is the group more interested in connection, or in defense against enemies?  

## 6. Drift Check
- Compared to last time I asked, has this group softened (more open, flexible) or hardened (more rigid, exclusionary)?  
- Am I more free or less free in my participation?

### 🔎 Scope Note
This checklist is designed for everyday community participation: clubs, workplaces, congregations, hobby groups, and neighborhoods.  

If your review shows traits of **high-closure communities** — severe exit costs, traitor/apostate framing, or siege mentality — this may be a **boundary signal** that the situation is beyond PoTM’s intended scope.  

📌 In such cases, consult the *Scope Boundaries* section of the **Advanced Practitioner Guide** for appropriate next steps and external resources.
