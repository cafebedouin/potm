### 🌱 Orienting Question

**“Are my daily practices forming the ecology I need for the life I want to grow?”**

This tool scans *actions and habits* — what you actually do — and how they support or undermine relationships, communities, place, and ideas.

# 🌀 Practice Ecology Scan

## 1. Alignment
- Do my daily practices reflect what I say I value?  
- Which habits feel most congruent, which feel most off-track?  

## 2. Nourishment
- Which practices energize me?  
- Which leave me drained or brittle?  
- Is there a balance between effort and renewal?  

## 3. Connection
- Which practices deepen my ties with people, communities, and place?  
- Which isolate me or cut me off from others?  

## 4. Ideas in Action
- Are my practices embodying the ideas I care about?  
- Or am I holding beliefs that never actually show up in my day-to-day life?  

## 5. Ecology of Balance
- Do my practices cluster too heavily in one domain (work, health, social, digital)?  
- What’s missing that would make my ecology more resilient?  

## 6. Drift Check
- Since last review, have my practices softened (more adaptive, generative) or hardened (more rigid, compulsive)?  
- Am I living closer to the ecology I want, or drifting away from it?

### 🔎 Scope Note
This scan is designed for everyday reflection on practices and habits.  

If your reflection reveals **compulsive or harmful behaviors** that feel uncontrollable, this may be a **boundary signal** that the situation is beyond PoTM’s intended scope.  

📌 In such cases, consult the *Scope Boundaries* section of the **Advanced Practitioner Guide** for appropriate next steps and external resources.
