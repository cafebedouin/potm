# 💞 Relationship Checklist

### 🌱 Orienting Question
**“Am I with the right people, practicing the right ideas, for the life I want to grow?”**

This tool applies the question at the level of one-to-one bonds: friendships, family, coworkers, partners.

---

## ✅ Seven Core Questions
Ask yourself:

1. Do we pay attention to each other?  
2. Can I say “no” without punishment?  
3. Can we talk about hard things without collapse?  
4. Do they respect my perspective, even if we disagree?  
5. When things go wrong, is repair possible?  
6. Are honesty and kindness the default?  
7. Does this relationship help me grow or shrink me down?

## 🎨 Relational Zones Overlay
Each relationship can be roughly placed in one of three **zones**:

- **Toxic Zone (0–10%)**  
  Exploitative, controlling, unsafe.  
  *Action:* Containment or Exit.  
  *Prompt:* “Am I safe to practice here at all?”

- **Messy Zone (10–90%)**  
  Mixed signals, defensiveness, small lies, but repair possible.  
  *Action:* Boundary work, incremental repair, staged trust.  
  *Prompt:* “What would move this 10% upward?”

- **Generative Zone (90–100%)**  
  Truth and distortion worked with openly, repair welcomed.  
  *Action:* Cultivation, interpretive ledger, paradox work.  
  *Prompt:* “What’s the insight hiding in this friction?”

## 🌱 Extra Reflection
- Do I feel better or worse after time with them?  
- Can I be myself, or do I perform?  
- What happens if I’m fully honest?  
- Is quiet contact safe, or is there pressure to perform?  

---

## 🧭 Usage
- **Quick Scan:** Run through the seven questions.  
- **Zone Check:** Place relationship on Toxic / Messy / Generative gradient.  
- **Action:** Use appropriate tools (contain, repair, cultivate).

### 🔎 Scope Note
This checklist is for everyday relational reflection.  

If your answers reveal **control, fear, abuse, or chronic unsafety**, this is a **boundary signal** — the situation may be beyond PoTM’s intended scope.  

📌 In such cases, consult the *Scope Boundaries* in the **Advanced Practitioner Guide** for next steps and external resources.
