### 🌱 Orienting Question

At the heart of this checklist lies a simple but powerful inquiry:

**“Am I with the right people, practicing the right ideas, for the life I want to grow?”**

This tool applies the question to **ideas, frameworks, and belief systems** that guide your choices.

# 💡 Ideas Checklist

## 1. Alignment
- Do these ideas align with my core values and lived experience?  
- Do they help me see more clearly, or do they obscure what is real?  

## 2. Growth
- Do these ideas expand my freedom, creativity, and responsibility?  
- Or do they narrow my choices, bind me in fear, or flatten complexity?  

## 3. Challenge
- Can these ideas tolerate questioning, critique, and revision?  
- Or do they collapse into dogma when challenged?  

## 4. Reciprocity
- Do these ideas give as much as they demand?  
- Are they nourishing in proportion to the energy I invest in them?  

## 5. Ecology
- How do these ideas interact with my communities and relationships?  
- Do they foster connection and understanding, or division and alienation?  

## 6. Drift Check
- Compared to last time I reflected, have these ideas softened (more flexible, generative) or hardened (more rigid, exclusionary)?  
- Do I feel more alive with them, or more constrained?

### 🔎 Scope Note
This checklist is designed for everyday reflection on ideas, beliefs, and frameworks.  

If your reflection reveals **coercive belief systems** (where dissent = betrayal, or where ideas demand total control of your life), this may be a **boundary signal** that the situation is beyond PoTM’s intended scope.  

📌 In such cases, consult the *Scope Boundaries* section of the **Advanced Practitioner Guide** for appropriate next steps and external resources.
