### üå± Orienting Question

At the heart of this checklist lies a simple but powerful inquiry:

**‚ÄúAm I with the right people, practicing the right ideas, for the life I want to grow?‚Äù**

This tool applies the question at the level of **place** ‚Äî the ecology of communities available where you live.

# üó∫Ô∏è Place Participation Checklist

## 1. Community Ecology
- How many distinct communities exist here that I could realistically join?  
- Is there diversity of values and practices, or does one group dominate?  
- Do I feel free to move between communities, or do all roads lead to the same center?  

## 2. Reputation & Overlap
- Does reputation in one community spill into others (as in small towns)?  
- Am I able to experiment without long-term reputational cost?  
- Do I feel constantly visible, or do I have privacy and fresh starts available?  

## 3. Mobility & Choice
- Can I leave one job, church, or group and find another nearby?  
- Is relocation within this place feasible, or are options logistically/economically constrained?  
- Do I have the freedom to try, fail, and reorient without exile?  

## 4. Fit & Growth
- Does this place‚Äôs ecology expand my options for growth, or limit them?  
- Are the people and ideas here aligned with where I want to head?  
- Does the culture of this place energize me, or does it diminish me?

### üîé Scope Note
This checklist is designed for everyday discernment about towns, cities, and regions as ecologies of belonging.  

If your reflection reveals conditions of **severe entrapment** ‚Äî such as systemic oppression, coercive surveillance, or lack of basic mobility ‚Äî this may be a **boundary signal** that the situation is beyond PoTM‚Äôs intended scope.  

üìå In such cases, consult the *Scope Boundaries* section of the **Advanced Practitioner Guide** for appropriate next steps and external resources.
