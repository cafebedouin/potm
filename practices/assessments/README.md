# Assessments — Preventive Maintenance in Practice

This section translates the **Preventive Maintenance Atlas** into runnable assessment practices.  
Each folder corresponds to one Atlas domain. Inside, you’ll find **checklists, scans, and filters** designed to catch drift early and keep life systems in balance.

## Structure

- **[belonging/](belonging/README.md)** → Community & relationship diagnostics  
- **[body/](body/README.md)** → Health and somatic self-checks  
- **[financial/](financial/README.md)** → Money stress & resilience scans  
- **[growth/](growth/README.md)** → Skills, learning, and career trajectory reviews  
- **[environment/](environment/README.md)** → Home, digital, and workspace audits  
- **[mental/](mental/README.md)** → Emotional and reflective self-checks  
- **[community/](community/README.md)** → Civic and neighborly engagement scans  
- **[risk/](risk/README.md)** → Contingency, emergency, and risk mapping

## How to Use

1. **Pick a domain** that feels most relevant right now.  
2. Run a **single checklist or scan** from that folder.  
3. Log what you notice (even one line is enough).  
4. Return later to expand into other domains.

*Tip:* The goal is not to complete them all, but to catch drift early. Small, regular attention > exhaustive one-time review.

## Cadence Maps

In addition to category-based organization, the assessments can also be navigated by **time rhythm**:

- [Assessment Cadence Map](assessment_cadence_map.md) — a neutral scaffold showing when each practice fits (daily → seasonal).  
- [Assessment Cadence Example](assessment_cadence_example.md) — a practitioner’s personalized calendar, showing one way the cadence can be lived.  

These files provide alternative entry points:  
- **Index.md** → browse by category.  
- **Cadence Map** → browse by timeframe.  
- **Cadence Example** → see how one practitioner put it into practice.
