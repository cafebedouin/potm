# 🪑 Workspace Focus Check

**Purpose:**  
Your workspace shapes attention. This scan reviews whether the environment helps or hinders focus, creativity, and well-being.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Ergonomics:** Is my chair, desk, and screen height healthy for posture?  
- [ ] **Lighting:** Is there enough natural or task lighting without strain?  
- [ ] **Noise:** Is the sound environment manageable (quiet, filtered, or controlled)?  
- [ ] **Clutter:** Is my desk clear enough to begin work without distraction?  
- [ ] **Tools:** Are the tools I use most often within easy reach and working?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Attention traps:** Are there visual or digital distractions in my workspace?  
- **Zones:** Do I have distinct zones for deep work, meetings, and rest?  
- **Energy:** Does the workspace feel motivating, or draining?  
- **Identity:** Does this space reflect who I want to be while working?  
- **Reset ritual:** Do I have a way to close/reset the workspace daily?
