# 🏠 Home Environment Checklist

**Purpose:**  
Your home is the base layer for health, rest, and focus. A regular scan ensures it supports well-being instead of slowly degrading into stress.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Safety:** Are smoke detectors, CO alarms, and fire extinguishers in place and functional?  
- [ ] **Security:** Are doors, windows, and locks working?  
- [ ] **Cleanliness:** Are major living areas free from clutter and dust build-up?  
- [ ] **Comfort:** Does temperature, lighting, and noise feel livable?  
- [ ] **Repairs:** Is anything broken or leaking that needs fixing?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Storage:** Are important documents (IDs, insurance, will) safe and accessible?  
- **Utilities:** Have I checked HVAC, water filters, and electrical safety this year?  
- **Emergency readiness:** Do I have flashlights, batteries, water, and non-perishables?  
- **Aesthetics:** Does my home feel like a place of rest, or just a storage unit?  
- **Community:** Do I feel comfortable inviting someone over?
