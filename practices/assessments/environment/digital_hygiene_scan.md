# 💻 Digital Hygiene Scan

**Purpose:**  
Digital environments drift like physical ones — clutter accumulates, systems weaken, attention leaks. This scan restores order and security.

---

## ✅ Quick Scan

- [ ] **Passwords:** Are they strong, unique, and stored in a manager?  
- [ ] **Backups:** Do I have working backups of key files (local + cloud)?  
- [ ] **Updates:** Are my devices and apps current with security patches?  
- [ ] **Inbox/files:** Have I cleared major clutter from email or storage?  
- [ ] **Notifications:** Are alerts limited to what truly matters?  

---

## 📋 Extended Prompts

- **Data footprint:** Do I need to delete old accounts or reduce app sprawl?  
- **Privacy:** Am I reviewing permissions (apps, browsers, social platforms)?  
- **Hardware:** Are devices slowing down or near end of life?  
- **Subscriptions:** Am I still paying for unused digital services?  
- **Attention:** Which digital spaces drain me most? Which support my goals?
