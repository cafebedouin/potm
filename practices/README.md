# 🌐 Practices Layer README

## Overview
The **Practices Layer** of PoTM provides concrete ways to engage with the framework.  
Practices are designed to be short, repeatable, and adaptable — ranging from **2-minute micro-practices** to **seasonal reviews**.  

They operate in three tiers:  
- **Micro-practices**: cards, journaling, zuihitsu, meditation  
- **Entry & routing**: guides like *Finding Your Best Starting Point*  
- **Maintenance & breadth**: tools like the *Preventive Atlas*  

---

## Core Practice Families
- 🃏 [Cards](./cards/README.md) — micro-practices drawn or chosen by intent  
- 📓 [Journal](./journal/README.md) — structured and open-ended writing for reflection  
- ✍️ [Zuihitsu](./zuihitsu/README.md) — fragmentary, spontaneous observation and thought  
- 🧘 [Meditation](./meditation/README.md) — concentration, noting, and open-awareness practices  

---

## Complementary Practices
Additional modalities expand the surface of engagement:

- **Somatic Check-ins** 🤲 — posture, breathing, PT tests, weight/waist logs  
- **Emotion Tracking** 💓 — daily mood rating, “3 feelings” lists  
- **Mind Clarity** 🧠 — fog/focus sliders, attention checks  
- **Relationship Pulse** 🤝 — short quality-of-connection checklists  
- **Environmental Anchors** 🌍 — noticing signals in space, movement, or community  

---

## Orientation Guides
Practices are not stand-alone; they are **oriented** by two meta-guides:

- 🌍 [Finding Your Best Starting Point](../practitioners/human/guides/finding_best_starting_point.md)  
  → Helps decide where to start today (body, emotions, mind, relationships/world).  
- 🗺️ [Preventive Atlas](../meta/preventive_atlas.md)  
  → Maps silent-drift domains for seasonal review and broader maintenance.  

---

## Feedback Loops
- Cards can seed journaling or zuihitsu.  
- Journals can surface themes for meditation or Atlas review.  
- Meditation deepens clarity that flows into all practices.  
- Atlas reviews can suggest which domains to emphasize in daily practice.  

---

## Temporal Rhythm
- **Daily** → draw 1–3 cards, journal 3–10 minutes, jot zuihitsu fragments, or meditate briefly  
- **Weekly** → check-in on body/emotions/mind/relationships, longer journaling or meditation  
- **Seasonal** → run a Preventive Atlas review to surface silent-drift domains  

---

### Lineage
- **Forge origin**: Integration design of the practice layer (cards + journal + zuihitsu + meditation + check-ins)  
- **Spiral evaluation**: Draft refined via Pal review for repo readiness
