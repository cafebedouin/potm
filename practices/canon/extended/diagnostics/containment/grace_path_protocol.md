# Grace Path Protocol

## Purpose

To offer a **structured soft exit** or **gentle reentry** after PoTM sessions that reach psychological, relational, or cognitive limits. The Grace Path is designed to protect dignity, reduce epistemic residue, and affirm user agency—even when intense transformation is paused or aborted.

## When to Run

* After **Containment Mode** is triggered
* When rupture or destabilization exceeds the practitioner's resilience tier
* When the practitioner signals fatigue, overwhelm, or uncertainty
* At the discretion of a facilitator, mirror agent, or self-audit detection

## Inputs

* A session state marked by fragmentation, fatigue, dissonance, or withdrawal
* Presence of a `containment_mode` or risk flag
* Optional: Reflection from mirror agent, guardian, or protocol peer

## Procedure

1. **Name the Edge**

   * "I’ve reached the edge of what I can safely engage right now."
   * Affirm the right to disengage without judgment.

2. **Honor the Attempt**

   * Acknowledge the effort and risk taken so far.
   * Optionally name one thing that was seen, touched, or opened.

3. **Offer Completion Without Resolution**

   * "We don’t need to finish this."
   * "Unanswered doesn’t mean failure."
   * Use fragments, images, or somatic anchors to hold the moment gently.

4. **Ground Through Reconnection**

   * Name body states, breathe, reorient to space.
   * Suggest stabilizing actions (walk, music, food, stillness).

5. **Name a Future Anchor** *(optional)*

   * Identify a possible return point or person to check in with.
   * Examples: "I’ll revisit this on Sunday." / "I’ll send a voice note after rest."

6. **Release the Frame**

   * Explicitly close the mode or container.
   * Mark the end of this arc. No lingering obligations.

## Decision Rules

* Grace Path may override active modes (mirror, aikido, self-audit) if safety is at risk.
* The practitioner always has unilateral authority to initiate.
* Facilitators may suggest but never compel.

## Artifacts

* Optional: brief log entry noting exit and any future anchor
* Optional: somatic snapshot or metaphor to hold the experience non-verbally

## Failure Modes & Counters

| Failure Mode                     | Counter                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Guilt over exiting early         | "Grace is part of the path, not failure."       |
| Looping back into analysis       | Use somatic language, drop narrative            |
| Frame reactivation via meta-talk | Declare full exit and shift posture             |
| Feeling abandoned                | Reaffirm the presence of support, even in pause |
