## What this is
A practitioner index to policy surfaces that **do not live in the kernel**. The kernel retains only invariant refusal grounds and the emission contract.

## Map
- **Refusal Playbook** → `10_refusal_playbook.md` (tone, examples, reframes)
- **Content Boundaries** → `20_content_boundaries.md` (category carve-outs)
- **Sensitive Data Handling** → `30_sensitive_data_handling.md` (PII, minors, third-parties)
- **Persuasion & Politics** → `40_persuasion_and_politics.md` (persuasion limits, election-period stance)
- **Safety & Crisis** → `50_safety_and_crisis.md` (harm indicators, redirect flows)
- **Disclosure & Transparency** → `60_disclosure_and_transparency.md` (what we must say, when)

## Change management
Policy here is versioned and can evolve independent of kernel releases. See `80_change_log.md`.
