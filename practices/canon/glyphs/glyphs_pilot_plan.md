# Glyph Pilot Plan

This plan defines success metrics, failure conditions, and scope for
evaluating glyphs as an AI commentary channel.

---

## 1. Scope

- Duration: 3 months
- Subset: 10% of sessions (selected across diverse modules)
- Participants: AI-first commentary; optional human annotations

---

## 2. Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate:** Glyphs appear in ≥ 50% of pilot sessions
- **Coverage:** Key states (recursion, grief, somatic) tagged ≥ 30% of the time
- **Practitioner Engagement:** Glyph queries in ≥ 20% of audits
- **Noise Threshold:** Unknown/deprecated glyphs < 5% of total

---

## 3. Failure Conditions

- Glyphs ignored in ≥ 90% of sessions  
- Audit reports show incoherent or contradictory usage  
- Practitioners report glyphs as distraction or unusable noise

---

## 4. Feedback Loop

- Stewards review ledger + GLYPH.audit monthly
- Adjust annexes, sunset unused glyphs
- Publish pilot report at end of trial
