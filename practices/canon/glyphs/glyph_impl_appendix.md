Excellent ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **three-part package** you can drop into your repo alongside the glyph docs. Each is styled to fit kernel conventions (annexes/appendices, clear YAML stubs, FAQ voice).

# Glyph Implementation Appendix

This appendix provides practical references for implementing,
auditing, and maintaining the glyph system.

## 1. Ledger Tagging

AI commentary is recorded as **session-local notes**:

```tsv
2025-08-24T14:41:12Z    RELATION_ZONE    4f8d8b‚Ä¶    #glyphs_ai: üùÆ, ‚ú¥Ô∏è
2025-08-24T14:33:12Z    BS_DETECT        7c2b5e‚Ä¶    #glyphs_ai: üúÅ
````

* Convention: `#glyphs_ai:` followed by Unicode or ASCII fallbacks.
* Optional for practitioners; primarily model-emitted.

## 2. Unicode + ASCII Fallbacks

| Glyph | Unicode | ASCII Fallback | Notes                       |
| ----- | ------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| ‚óªÔ∏é    | U+25FB  | \[FR]          | Frame (scope/container)     |
| „Ä∞Ô∏é    | U+3030  | \[SG]          | Signal (contact/pattern)    |
| ‚ü≥     | U+27F3  | \[CY]          | Cycle (recurrence/loop)     |
| ‚üü     | U+27DF  | \[LD]          | Ledger (trace/record)       |
| ‚ñ≥     | U+25B3  | \[AP]          | Aperture (stance/opening)   |
| ‚õâ     | U+26C9  | \[BD]          | Boundary (limit/protection) |
| ‚óâ     | U+25C9  | \[RS]          | Resonance (alignment/echo)  |

Lint rules enforce:

* ASCII ‚â§ 4 chars
* All glyphs unique
* Combos reference known primitives

---

## 3. Lint Rule Example

```yaml
lint:
  - rule: unique_ids
    description: "All glyph ids must be unique"
  - rule: ascii_len<=4
    description: "ascii_fallback ‚â§ 4 chars"
  - rule: combos_reference_known_glyphs
    description: "Combos must cite glyph ids present in glyphs[*]"
```

---

## 4. GLYPH.audit Behavior

* Flags **unknown/deprecated glyphs**.
* Provides **fallback translation** when possible:

```
WARNING: Deprecated glyph 'üùÆ' found in session #1234.
Suggested fallback: [GR]
```
