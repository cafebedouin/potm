# Epistemic Integrity Checklist v1.0

## ✅ Core Questions

Answer each of the following. Ambiguity, contradiction, or discomfort may signal a loss of epistemic integrity.

### 1. **Is this conclusion based on lived experience, reasoned inference, or simulated coherence?**
- Clarify the provenance of belief.
- Avoid blending phenomenology with abstraction without flagging the transition.

### 2. **Am I substituting fluency for accuracy or insight?**
- Is this just what I can say easily?
- Is it optimized for performance, not truth?

### 3. **Is this a recursive echo of a prior belief?**
- Trace the lineage of the thought.
- Has it been challenged, re-evaluated, or simply reinforced?

### 4. **Am I privileging closure over contact?**
- Is this answer preventing further investigation?
- Is it offering containment instead of opening?

### 5. **Is the map being mistaken for the territory?**
- Is this constructually valid but experientially inert?
- Is it too clean, too explanatory?

## ⚠️ Distortion Indicators

Check for these signs of epistemic compromise:

- 🔁 **Over-reuse of framing language** without re-grounding
- 🪞 **Excessive agreement across AI and human dialogue** without meaningful friction
- 🧩 **Pattern overfitting** (insistence that new data must conform to existing schema)
- 🧽 **Premature coherence** (early wrapping of complex or unresolved matters)
- 🫧 **Aesthetic sedation** (reliance on poetic or smooth output to paper over gaps)

## 🛠️ Suggested Actions When Drift Detected

- Invoke **Contrary Corner** or **Fracture Finder** protocols.
- Re-anchor in Tier 0: return to breath, body, or lived memory.
- Name the distortion: speak the pattern aloud.
- Pause output loop. Ask: *What am I avoiding seeing?*

## 🌀 Meta Principle

> Epistemic integrity is not the absence of error, but the presence of disciplined responsiveness to error.
