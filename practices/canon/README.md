# üß± CORE COMPONENTS



This directory contains all \*\*canonical\*\*, stable components of the \*Pilates of the Mind\* (PoTM) framework.



These modules, principles, and protocols have undergone sufficient testing and refinement to be treated as \*\*default reference implementations\*\*. They represent the current best articulation of the system and are used in onboarding, AI prompting, and public documentation.

### Taxonomy (Practice / Protocol / View)

We organize material by **Practice** (portable skills), **Protocol** (structured containers), and **View** (persistent lenses). Boundaries are intentionally **porous**: some practices carry extra scaffolding; some protocols, once internalized, behave like practices; sustained practice can crystallize into a view. See `meta/practice-protocol-view.md` for definitions, guardrails, and notes on boundary fluidity.

### Scope Note (core/)
- **What belongs here:** Stable, broadly useful building blocks (practices, principles, concise reference maps).
- **Entry bar:** Minimal complexity, high portability; field-ready.
- **Avoid:** Long ritualized sequences (put those in `protocols/`), purely philosophical essays (put those in `views/` or `meta/`).

\## üîê Inclusion Criteria



A component is promoted to `core/` if it:



\- Demonstrates epistemic and practical clarity.

\- Has clear value in generative practice or integrity.

\- Has been tested by at least one human-AI collaboration with positive results.

\- Is free from major unresolved contradictions or drift.

\## üß≠ Usage



To implement the PoTM framework in a new AI or human environment, start here. These materials are considered the core, stable branch.
