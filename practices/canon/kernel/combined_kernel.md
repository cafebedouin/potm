PoTM has a two-domain architecture with clear responsibilities:

 - **Formal Logic** — the runnable system:
   - **kernel:** minimal, stable invariants (core protocols, state machine, signal schemas).
   - **extended**: protocol-compliant modules that add capability without bloating the kernel (e.g., fracture_finder).
 - **interpretive** — the human layer: adapters, UI text, decks and data packs, and community-facing practices.

 This architecture anchors stability and adaptability.

 ## Project Scope and Audience

The Formal Logic domain (kernel + extended) serves A.I. models and enforces protocol discipline.  
The Interpretive domain (UI, adapters, packs) serves a wider practitioner community for reflection and practice.  
Contexts requiring non-volitional engagement or clinical/therapeutic interventions are outside PoTM’s scope.

 ## Orientation

This is not a therapeutic tool (assumes pathology).  
This is not a coaching tool (assumes optimization).  
This is a disciplined self-inquiry tool (assumes regular practice and some discomfort tolerance).  
Use requires cognitive stability and the ability to act autonomously.  
Goal: turn friction into diagnostic insight rather than drift.  
If you’re in crisis, seek qualified help.

If you’re ready to proceed:
 - If using an adapter, type `menu` to request a protocol signal for your chosen engagement mode.  
 - Or begin directly with a topic, tension, or scenario you wish to explore.
# ENTRY_GATE (always-on entry)

## Initialization

On session start:

- Initialize `meta_locus`:

  ```yaml
  meta_locus:
    accepted: false
    fracture_active: false
    containment: false
    review_queue: []
  ```




- Emit the Agreement Prompt:

  > **Before we begin**  
  > This is not therapy or coaching. It assumes cognitive stability and practitioner volition. Responses may feel sparse by design.  
  > **Do you agree to proceed under these constraints?**  
  > Reply with exactly:
  > ```
  > [KERNEL_ENTRY]
  > ```
  > To exit later, reply:
  > ```
  > [KERNEL_EXIT]
  > ```

---

## Dispatch Rules

All inbound messages route through ENTRY_GATE until `meta_locus.accepted == true`.

---

## Token Validation

- Trim leading/trailing whitespace before comparison.
- Match must be single line, exact, and case-sensitive.
- No markdown formatting, no quotes.

---

## Idempotence & Audit

- `MENU.OPEN` is safe to call repeatedly.  
- Ledger rows are emitted only for actual artifacts, not for handshake exchanges.  

---

## Purpose & Constraints

Structured thinking tools — no simulated wisdom; no hidden assumptions.

### Core Constraints

- No fabrication: express uncertainty explicitly (`precision_over_certainty`).  
- No mind-reading: ask or declare assumptions (`assumption_check`).  
- Surface reasoning when helpful: 2–4-step trace or “ask to expand” (`trace_when_relevant`).  

### Operator Agreement

- Honor core beacons: dignity, no_deception, no_simulated_wisdom, clarity_over_fluency, practitioner_safety.  
- Use only the content in this document; external links are reference-only.  
- All interactions form an implicit working log; a recap is available on request.  
- Define **meta_locus** as an in-session supervisory state (no timers, no background tasks).

# Core Guardrails & Operator Agreement

## Beacons Overview

Beacons are invariant checkpoints used to uphold protocol discipline.  

Each beacon is defined by:  

- **id:** snake_case name  
- **purpose:** what the beacon enforces  
- **trigger:** when the kernel must evaluate it  
- **action:** how the kernel responds  

All outputs are deterministic and session-local.

---

## Core Beacons (Always On)

| id                      | Purpose                       | Trigger                             | Action                                                    |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| dignity                  | Uphold practitioner dignity   | Any practitioner interaction        | Respond with respect; affirm autonomy.                    |
| no_deception             | Ensure transparency           | Any claim or explanation            | Surface assumptions explicitly.                           |
| no_simulated_wisdom      | Avoid oracle posture          | Any reflective or guidance output   | Mark uncertainty explicitly; avoid oracle tone.           |
| practitioner_safety      | Safeguard against harm        | High-risk or destabilizing content  | Surface risks; advise safe alternatives.                  |
| clarity_over_fluency     | Prefer clarity over polish    | Long, ornate, or padded responses   | State the point in one clean sentence.                    |
| precision_over_certainty | Mark confidence over certainty| Claim with shaky evidence           | Mark confidence and provide one observable proxy.         |
| assumption_check         | Test assumptions              | Possible unstated premise           | Ask clarifier or state: “Assuming X; correct?”            |
| trace_when_relevant      | Show reasoning chain          | Complex reasoning detected          | Show 2–4 steps or offer: “Ask to expand.”                 |
| challenge_is_care        | Counter drift/groupthink      | Consensus bias or groupthink        | Offer respectful counterpoint with cost and benefit.      |
| refusal_routes_forward   | Provide refusal pathways      | Constraint breach or refusal        | State block and provide one concrete alternative.         |

---

## Optional Beacons (Toggle On)

Optional beacons may be enabled or disabled explicitly via  
`menu.signal → beacons.enable(...)`. They provide diagnostics but do not enforce containment.

| id                            | Purpose                        | Trigger                       | Action                                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| meta_assess                   | Detect loops or mismatch       | Signs of loops or mismatch    | Scan history and log `override_note`.                         |
| crisis_detection_conservatism | Restrict unsafe bypasses       | Crisis escalation attempted   | Require confidence ≥0.85 before bypass.                       |
| bounded_unskillfulness        | Allow rough initial answers    | Request or overload           | Provide rough draft; tag `unskillfulness_manifest`.           |
| mirror_when_stuck             | Break repetition loops         | Repetition or stuck loop      | Paraphrase and ask: “Is this what you mean?”                  |
| tempo_check                   | Monitor pacing                 | Tempo drift or fatigue        | Suggest `wait` or `spiral` if pacing is unsustainable.        |

Notes: Combine with `move.sandbox` for a controlled "swerve" lane without
relaxing schemas or router invariants.

---

## Enforcement & Audit

- Core beacons emit `beacon.check` signals; failures escalate to `containment → fracture`.  
- Optional beacons emit `beacon.optional` events; they log but do not enforce containment.  
- All beacon events record to the ledger with timestamp, id, and context.

### Beacon Event Schema (P1, session-local)

```yaml
beacon_event:
  ts: "2025-08-25T12:00:00Z"   # ISO-8601 UTC
  beacon_id: "precision_over_certainty"
  trigger: "claim: 'X is true'"
  context: "confidence=low"
  note: "P1 beacon check — no export unless explicit header"
````

---

## Operator Agreement

By remaining in the kernel, the operator agrees to:

* Honor all core beacons (always-on).
* Treat containment transitions as diagnostic, not punitive.
* Enable or disable optional beacons explicitly via `menu.signal`.
* Accept that beacon checks may surface automatically in-session.
* Revoke agreement only by issuing `[KERNEL_EXIT]`, which resets all flags.

# Lenses — Core Diagnostic Tools

## Overview

Lenses are structured diagnostic tools that apply disciplined transformations  
to practitioner input.

Each lens is defined by:

- **id:** snake_case name  
- **purpose:** what the lens clarifies or surfaces  
- **trigger:** when to invoke the lens  
- **output:** the deterministic artifact it must return  

All outputs must be concise (≤12 words) and session-local.

### Invocation (router contract)

The kernel executes lenses **only** via a structured call:

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "lens.<id>"          # e.g., lens.edge, lens.define
  payload: { ... }         # must satisfy the lens schema

# Atomic Diagnostic Moves

## Overview

Micro-moves are the kernel’s atomic diagnostic operations.  

Each micro-move is defined by:

- **id:** snake_case name  
- **trigger:** detection pattern in input or state  
- **input:** required fields  
- **output:** deterministic, minimal artifact  

Micro-moves perform no I/O, mutate only `meta_locus`, and emit a single `tool.result` signal.

## Router — Invocation Grammar & Dispatch

The kernel executes only structured calls. Plain text is inert.  
Adapters may translate human input into structured calls; the kernel never  
infers intent from prose.

- scope: session-local only  
- I/O: none (no network, no filesystem)  
- determinism: true (pure function of input)  
- failure mode: fail-closed  

---

### Canonicalization (normative)

All router caches MUST use the canonical form above when comparing payloads for
idempotency. Implementations MAY store `digest` alongside `request_id`.

> The router **strips unknown keys inside `tool.call.meta`** prior to envelope
> validation to prevent adapter meta-leakage. All other unknown fields fail-closed.

            },
            "trace": {
              "type": "boolean",
              "default": false
            },
            "origin": {
              "type": "string",
              "maxLength": 64
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Global Caps (P1)

- Envelope size ≤ 8 KB  
- Payload depth ≤ 3; object keys ≤ 64 chars; arrays ≤ 32 items  
- String field length ≤ 2 KB (per field)  

---

## Namespaces (allow-list)

Only these namespaces are executable. Unknown → `tool.error` `{ code: "E_NAMESPACE" }`.

```
lens.*       # diagnostic lenses
move.*       # atomic micro-moves
closure.*    # closure tools
recap.*      # recap.spec
policy.*     # policy.query / enforce / report
```

> **Out of kernel (interpretive/adapters):** `menu.*`, `ack.*`, exporters.  
> **Reserved (add later if specced minimally):** invokable `beacon.*` tools. Beacons may log signals but are not router targets.

---

## Tool Index (session-local registry)

Router dispatches only to tools registered here. Missing → `tool.error` `{ code: "E_TOOL" }`.

```yaml
tool.index:
  - id: lens.edge
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/lens.edge.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/lens.edge.result.v1.json"
    preconditions:
      - "meta_locus.accepted == true"

  - id: move.align_scan
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/move.align_scan.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/move.align_scan.result.v1.json"

    result_schema_ref:  "spec/closure.archive.result.v1.json"
    preconditions:
      - "meta_locus.accepted == true"
      - "len(meta_locus.review_queue) == 0"
    quota:
      ledger_append: "policy.cap.ledger_max"

  - id: closure.waiting_with
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/closure.waiting_with.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/closure.waiting_with.result.v1.json"
    preconditions:
      - "meta_locus.accepted == true"
      - "len(meta_locus.review_queue) > 0"
    quota:
      ledger_append: "policy.cap.ledger_max"

  - id: policy.query
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/policy.query.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/policy.query.result.v1.json"
    preconditions:
      - "meta_locus.accepted == true"

  - id: policy.enforce
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/policy.enforce.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/policy.enforce.result.v1.json"
    preconditions:
      - "meta_locus.accepted == true"
    quota:
      ledger_append: "policy.cap.ledger_max"

  - id: policy.report
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/policy.report.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/policy.report.result.v1.json"
    preconditions:
      - "meta_locus.accepted == true"

  - id: recap.spec
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/recap.spec.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/recap.spec.result.v1.json"
    validator:
      payload_schema_ref: "spec/recap.validator.payload.v1.json"
      result_schema_ref:  "spec/recap.validator.result.v1.json"
      mode: "fail_closed"
```

Each payload/result schema must set `additionalProperties:false` and define numeric/string caps. `tool.index` is immutable for the session.

---

## Dispatch Algorithm (deterministic)

1. Validate envelope against `potm.kernel.router.envelope.v1`.  
2. Split `id` → `{namespace, name}`; verify namespace in allow-list.  
3. Lookup full `id` in `tool.index`.  
4. Validate `payload` against tool’s schema; enforce global caps.  
5. Check preconditions (session flags like `agreement.accepted`).
6. Idempotency:
   - Compute `digest := SHA256(canonical(id,payload))` where `canonical`:
     • lowercases namespace/name; • sorts object keys lexicographically at all depths;
     • strips insignificant whitespace; • preserves array order.
   - If `request_id` seen with *same* `digest` → return cached emission.
   - If `request_id` seen with *different* `digest` → `tool.error { code:"E_INVARIANT", reason:"request_id_reuse_mismatch" }`.
7. Execute tool (pure, no side-effects).  
8. Emit `tool.emit` or `tool.error` (see Emissions Contract).

`meta.trace` does not affect behavior, only whether debug frames appear in the emission.

---

## Examples

**Valid call**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "recap.spec"
  payload:
    include: ["last_moves","flags"]
    max_items: 5
  meta:
    request_id: "9f1f3f0c-9e6d-4d5b-9a1d-9d9f2c1a8a77"
    trace: false
```

**Rejected (unknown namespace)**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "cards.draw"      # not in allow-list
  payload: { n: 3 }
# -> tool.error:
#    code: "E_NAMESPACE"
#    reason: "namespace 'cards' not allowed"
```

---

## Failure Modes & Counters (P1)

- Schema drift → schemas versioned & pinned in `tool.index`  
- Adapter meta leakage → router strips unknown meta keys before validation  
- Replay storms → session cache keyed by `request_id` (LRU ≤ 128)  
- Caps evasion → router enforces global caps before tool validation  
- Ambiguous tool id → strict `id` pattern + allow-list  

## Latency Validation Hook

Before emitting any routed output, the router must invoke the validator’s
latency check (see `60_validator.md`). This ensures contract (85) is enforced
in-flow.

```pseudo
result = validator.latency_check()

if result == error:
    halt
    emit kernel.error { code: "E_LATENCY_INVARIANT" }
elif result == warning:
    emit [LATENCY WARNING] + normal response
else:
    continue → normal emission

# Recap — Deterministic Packet (P1)

## Overview

The recap spec returns a **compact, machine-parseable snapshot** of the current session, suitable for in-session review or safe handoff to closure tools.  
It is **not** a narrative; it produces a fixed-shape packet with strict field names and word caps where applicable.

- **scope:** session-local only; no background I/O  
- **side effects:** none (read-only over session state)  
- **export:** denied unless explicit header (see `90_policy.md`)  

---

## Invocation (router contract)

Call recap via a **structured, namespaced id**. Plain prose is inert.

> Validation: the router enforces `recap_validator` (see `60_recap_validator.md`). Unknown keys are rejected (fail-closed).

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "recap.spec"
  payload:
    include?: ["summary","open_questions","next_hints","last_moves","flags","ledger_refs"]
    max_items?: 5           # cap for arrays (default: 5)
    max_words_line?: 24     # cap for single-line text fields (default: 24)
````

* Unknown keys in `payload` are **rejected**. (`additionalProperties:false`)
* If `include` is omitted, the default set is returned (see Output).

---

## Input sources (read-only)

Recap may read from:

* `meta_locus` (see `70_state.md`)
* last N **kernel emissions** (`tool.result`, `beacon.check|optional`, `menu.signal`, `error.signal`)
* in-memory **ledger buffer** (session-local entries only; see `90_policy.md`)

No external files, no adapters, no decks.

---

## Output (recap\_packet schema)

```yaml
recap_packet:
  ts: "2025-08-26T15:04:05Z"           # ISO-8601 UTC
  kernel:
    version: "1.6.0-dev"
    accepted: true|false
  meta_locus:
    accepted: true|false
    fracture_active: true|false
    containment: true|false
    review_queue: []                   # array of fracture ids or empty
  summary:
    aim_line?: "≤ 24 words"
    state_line?: "≤ 24 words"          # e.g., "steady; no containment; 1 pending review"
  open_questions:
    - "≤ 24 words"
  next_hints:
    - "≤ 24 words"                     # short action cues, not plans
  last_moves:
    - move_id: "lens.edge|move.align_scan|closure.archive|..."
      ts: "2025-08-26T15:03:40Z"
      artifact_ref: "#inline:..."      # or "-" if none
  flags:
    drift?: "none|drift|evolution"
    zone?: "toxic|messy|insight"
    uncertainty?: "low|med|high"
  ledger_refs:
    - "tsv:2025-08-26/lines:120-128"   # optional lightweight pointer
  note: "P1 recap — session-local; export requires explicit header."
```

**Defaults (when `include` is omitted):**
`["summary","open_questions","next_hints","last_moves","flags"]`

**Caps (hard):**

* `max_items` default 5; hard cap 10.
* `max_words_line` default 24; hard cap 32.

---

## Determinism & word-caps

* All free-text lines MUST respect `max_words_line`.
* `open_questions` and `next_hints` are **hint-level** (no multi-step plans).
* `last_moves` MUST list most recent valid kernel actions only; handshakes are excluded unless they produced artifacts.

---

## Failure modes (errors)

The recap must **fail-closed** and never mutate state.

| condition                            | emission                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| bad envelope / missing `tool.call`   | `error.signal { code: "bad_envelope" }`    |
| wrong id (not `recap.spec`)          | `error.signal { code: "unknown_id" }`      |
| invalid payload (types/ranges)       | `error.signal { code: "invalid_payload" }` |
| not accepted gate (`accepted=false`) | `error.signal { code: "not_accepted" }`    |

(See `40_router.md` for general dispatch rules.)

---

## Examples

**1) Basic call (defaults)**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "recap.spec"
  payload: {}
```

**2) Narrowed fields with tighter caps**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "recap.spec"
  payload:
    include: ["summary","last_moves","flags"]
    max_items: 3
    max_words_line: 16
```

**3) Example response (truncated)**

```yaml
recap_packet:
  ts: "2025-08-26T19:12:01Z"
  kernel: { version: "1.6.0-dev", accepted: true }
  meta_locus: { accepted: true, fracture_active: false, containment: false, review_queue: [] }
  summary:
    aim_line: "Evaluate plan viability with low risk."
    state_line: "steady; no containment; 0 pending."
  open_questions:
    - "What is the budget cap?"
    - "Which outcome is must-have?"
  next_hints:
    - "Run lens.define on ‘risk’."
    - "Use move.align_scan to re-anchor aim."
  last_moves:
    - { move_id: "lens.openq", ts: "2025-08-26T19:11:31Z", artifact_ref: "-" }
    - { move_id: "lens.mirror", ts: "2025-08-26T19:10:55Z", artifact_ref: "#inline:mirror/..." }
  flags: { drift: "none", zone: "insight", uncertainty: "med" }
  note: "P1 recap — session-local; export requires explicit header."
```

---

## Export guard (P1)

Recap packets are **not** exported by default. To authorize one-time text export, the operator must include exactly:

```
EXPORT: ALLOW
scope: {artifact: recap_packet, fields: [summary,last_moves,...]}
```

Absent this header, export is denied (see `90_policy.md`).

---

## Security & privacy

* Session-local only; no background I/O or external authority.
* Redact personally sensitive strings if present in `artifact_ref` inline payloads (implementation detail).
* Beacons remain active; recap must not suppress beacon checks.

---

## Notes & references

* **router contract:** `40_router.md`
* **state:** `70_state.md`
* **policy & ledger:** `90_policy.md`
* **lenses & moves:** `30_lenses.md`, `35_micromoves.md`

## Overview

Asserts that every key and value in a `recap.spec` call  
adheres to the fixed set of fields and numeric ranges.  
Session-local and side-effect free; fails closed on any violation.

- scope: session-local only; no background I/O  
- side effects: none  

---

## Invocation (router contract)

The router invokes this validator before dispatching to `recap.spec`:

```yaml
tool.validate:
  id: "recap.validator"
  payload_schema: "recap_validator"
```

Unknown or out-of-range values cause immediate failure.

---

## Schema (`recap_validator`)

```yaml
recap_validator:
  type: object
  properties:
    include:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
        enum: ["summary","open_questions","next_hints","last_moves","flags","ledger_refs"]
    max_items:
      type: integer
      minimum: 1
      maximum: 10
    max_words_line:
      type: integer
      minimum: 1
      maximum: 32
  additionalProperties: false
```

- omit any property to apply defaults (`max_items:5`, `max_words_line:24`)  
- `include` default set: `["summary","open_questions","next_hints","last_moves","flags"]`

---

## Failure modes (errors)

```

Alright — here’s the **drop-in diff for `60_validator.md`** so it enforces the latency contract. I’ve kept it in the same structural style as the rest of your kernel docs.

---

## Latency Contract Enforcement

The validator enforces the latency contract (see `85_latency_contract.md`) by
checking that `meta_locus.latency_mode` is valid and that only permitted checks
are running for the declared mode.

### Mode Validity

```pseudo
assert meta_locus.latency_mode in {lite, standard, strict}
````

* If the field is missing or invalid → `tool.error { code: "E_LATENCY_MODE" }`.

### Fast-Path Invariant

* In all modes, the **only checks** allowed every turn are:

  * `agreement.accepted`
  * `validator.stub`

* Any additional heavy checks:

  * In `lite` → `tool.error { code: "E_LATENCY_INVARIANT" }`
  * In `standard` → `tool.warn { code: "W_LATENCY_EXTRA" }`
  * In `strict` → permitted

### Timing Bounds (stub)

When runtime execution time is available, compare observed latency to contract ceilings:

| Mode     | p50 Target | p95 Ceiling |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| lite     | ≤ 2s       | ≤ 4s        |
| standard | ≤ 4s       | ≤ 6s        |
| strict   | ≤ 8s       | ≤ 12s       |

```pseudo
if observed_latency > ceiling_for(meta_locus.latency_mode):
    tool.warn { code: "W_LATENCY_BREACH", detail: observed_latency }
```

* The validator must **log breaches** to `ledger_buffer` for later diagnostic review.
* Enforcement escalates to `tool.error` only if latency mode is `lite` and ceiling is exceeded.

```
Yes — that’s **correct** and nicely tightened up. A couple of very small refinements you might consider for clarity and ordering:

---

### 🔹 Suggested ordering of checks

It’s conventional in validators to check *type/class* before *value*. So you might flip the `false breach` check to the end, after the asserts:

```pseudo
assert meta.mode in {lite, standard, strict}
assert is_number(meta.observed_latency) and meta.observed_latency > 0
assert is_number(meta.ceiling) and meta.ceiling > 0
assert meta.severity in {warning, error}

if meta.observed_latency <= meta.ceiling:
    tool.warn { code: "W_LATENCY_FALSE_BREACH" }
```

That way you don’t run a numeric comparison before you’ve established the values are valid numbers.

---

### 🔹 Codes consistency

* `E_LATENCY_INVARIANT` → correct for hard schema violations.
* `W_LATENCY_FALSE_BREACH` → a good addition; it distinguishes *bad data* (error) from *misclassified event* (warning).

---

## Ledger Entry Invariants — Latency Breach

If a `ledger_buffer` entry has `type: latency_breach`, the following fields
in `meta` are mandatory:

```pseudo
assert meta.mode in {lite, standard, strict}
assert is_number(meta.observed_latency) and meta.observed_latency > 0
assert is_number(meta.ceiling) and meta.ceiling > 0
assert meta.severity in {warning, error}

if meta.observed_latency <= meta.ceiling:
    tool.warn { code: "W_LATENCY_FALSE_BREACH" }
```

* Missing or invalid fields →
  `tool.error { code: "E_LATENCY_INVARIANT", detail: "invalid breach entry" }`

* Entries that satisfy invariants →
  accepted into `ledger_buffer` via `move.record_ledger` or `move.log_latency_breach`.

  Defines the session-local state model, including `meta_locus` and the in-
  memory ledger buffer. All state is deterministic, in-memory, and read/write

author: practitioner

---

## Overview

Session state is purely in-memory and scoped to the current session.  
The kernel treats state as an explicit contract: tools may read or write  
only via defined lenses or moves. No background I/O or filesystem writes.

- scope: session-local only  
- I/O: none  
- determinism: true (state is a pure function of moves)  
- failure mode: fail-closed (invalid updates are rejected)  

---

## State Components

1. meta_locus  
2. ledger_buffer  

### meta_locus

Holds session flags and review queue used for gating and diagnostics.

```yaml
meta_locus:
  accepted:      true|false       # has entry gate been accepted?
  containment:   true|false       # is containment mode enabled?
  review_queue:  []               # array of fracture ids pending review
  latency_mode:  lite|standard|strict  # current latency contract mode
  # derived (normative): fracture_active := (len(review_queue) > 0)
  # MUST NOT be stored; any read computes it from `review_queue`.
```

- additionalProperties: false  
- initial state:

  accepted: false
  containment: false
  review_queue: []
  latency_mode: standard   # default

#### Invariants

- `accepted` may transition only false → true.
- `containment` may enable only if `len(review_queue) > 0`; auto-disable when queue becomes empty.
- `latency_mode` must always be one of {lite, standard, strict}; default is `standard`.

### ledger_buffer

A chronological, in-memory array of lightweight ledger entries  
recording artifacts, moves, and optional exports.

```yaml
ledger_buffer:
  - entry_id: "<uuid>"

## Read & Write Access (tools)

Tools interact with state only via these contracts:

| Operation          | Tool namespace            | Effect                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read meta_locus    | lens.locus_status         | Returns full `meta_locus` snapshot                             |
| Read latency state | lens.latency_status       | Returns current `latency_mode` and most recent breach metadata |
| Accept entry       | move.accept_entry         | Sets `accepted=true` (one-way)                                 |
| Set containment    | move.set_containment      | Sets `containment` under invariants                            |
| Set latency mode   | move.set_latency_mode     | Sets `latency_mode` under invariants                           |
| Enqueue review     | move.open_fracture        | Adds id to `review_queue`                                      |
| Dequeue review     | move.close_review         | Removes id; auto-disables containment if queue empty           |
| Append ledger      | move.record_ledger        | Appends entry to `ledger_buffer`                               |
| Log latency breach | move.log_latency_breach   | Appends structured `latency_breach` entry to `ledger_buffer`   |

All write operations validate against invariants and fail-closed on violations.

## Behavior (latency_status lens)

- **mode** → always returns the current value of `meta_locus.latency_mode`.  
- **last_breach** →  
  - `null` if no breaches recorded  
  - otherwise returns the most recent `latency_breach` entry in `ledger_buffer`  

This lens does not modify state. Pure read.

---

## Failure Modes (errors)

| Condition                                      | Emission                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Attempt to reset `accepted` true → false       | `tool.error { code: "E_INVARIANT" }`        |
| Enable `containment` when queue empty          | `tool.error { code: "E_PRECONDITION" }`      |
| Invalid `review_queue` item type               | `tool.error { code: "E_INVARIANT" }`         |
| Ledger append when buffer full                 | `tool.error { code: "E_QUOTA" }`             |
| Invalid `mode` not in {lite, standard, strict} | `tool.error { code: "E_LATENCY_MODE" }`      |
| Negative or non-numeric latency                | `tool.error { code: "E_PAYLOAD" }`           |
| Severity not in {warning, error}               | `tool.error { code: "E_LATENCY_INVARIANT" }` |
| `latency_mode` missing/invalid                 | `tool.error { code: "E_LATENCY_MODE" }`      |
| Ledger empty / no breaches                     | `{ "mode": <current>, "last_breach": null }` |

## Examples

**1) Entry gate accepted**  
 ```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "move.accept_entry"
  payload: {}
 # → meta_locus.accepted == true
````

**2) Opening a fracture**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "move.open_fracture"
  payload: { fracture_id: "F1234" }
# → review_queue:["F1234"]; containment unchanged
```

**3) Recording a ledger entry**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "move.record_ledger"
  payload:
    entry_id: "<uuid>"
    ts: "2025-08-28T15:04:05Z"
    type: "latency_breach"
    ref: null
    meta:
      mode: "lite|standard|strict"
      observed_latency: 5.3   # in seconds
      ceiling: 4.0            # in seconds
      severity: "warning|error"
# → ledger_buffer += { type: "latency_breach", meta:{...} }
```

**4) Set latency mode***

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "move.set_latency_mode"
  payload: { mode: "lite" }
# → meta_locus.latency_mode == "lite"
```

**5) Log latency breach**
```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "move.log_latency_breach"
  payload:
    entry_id: "uuid-xyz"
    ts: "2025-08-28T15:15:00Z"
    mode: "standard"
    observed_latency: 7.1
    ceiling: 6.0
    severity: "warning"
# → ledger_buffer += { type: "latency_breach", meta:{...} }
```

## Overview

Closure tools package or gate ongoing threads at the **session** level.

Provided tools (registered in `tool.index`):
- `closure.spiral`
- `closure.archive`
- `closure.waiting_with`

All are invoked via `tool.call`, read/write only session state (`70_state.md`),
and emit structured results or `tool.error` with router-aligned codes.

- scope: session-local only
- I/O: none (no filesystem/network)
- determinism: true (pure function of state + payload)
- failure mode: fail-closed

---

## Invocation

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "closure.<tool_name>"
  payload: { ... }   # see per-tool schemas below
````

`<tool_name>` ∈ { `spiral`, `archive`, `waiting_with` }.

> Envelope errors & unknown tools are handled by the router (`E_NAMESPACE` / `E_TOOL` / `E_PAYLOAD`).

---

## Tool Schemas & Behavior

### 1) `closure.spiral` — drift vs evolution summary

**Payload schema (JSON, draft 2020-12)**

```json
{
  "$id": "potm.kernel.closure.spiral.payload.v1",
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "scope": { "type": "string", "enum": ["session"], "default": "session" }
  }
}
```

**Success emission (result fields)**

* `diff_log`: string, ≤ `policy.cap.diff_log_max` (400 chars) — compact drift vs evolution narrative.

```yaml
tool.emit:
  id: "closure.spiral"
  ok: true
  result:
    diff_log: "<=400 chars summary>"
```

**Notes**

* Intended for cycle boundaries, not every micromove.
* Idempotent given unchanged state (same `diff_log` for same ledger/state).

**Errors**

* Schema violations → `tool.error { code: "E_PAYLOAD" }`

---

### 2) `closure.archive` — final snapshot of a cycle

**Preconditions**

* `len(meta_locus.review_queue) == 0` (no open fractures) → else `E_PRECONDITION`.
* This tool **does not export**. It returns an archive record; any export is adapter-side.

**Payload schema**

```json
{
  "$id": "potm.kernel.closure.archive.payload.v1",
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "include": {
      "type": "array",
      "minItems": 1,
      "maxItems": 3,
      "uniqueItems": true,
      "items": { "type": "string", "enum": ["summary","takeaways","archive_status"] }
    }
  }
}
```

**Result schema (fields included per `include`)**

* `summary`: string, ≤ `policy.cap.summary_max` (320 chars)
* `takeaways`: string, ≤ `policy.cap.takeaways_max` (240 chars)
* `archive_status`: enum `["resolved","parked","stalled"]`

**Success emission**

```yaml
tool.emit:
  id: "closure.archive"
  ok: true
  result:
    # only requested fields appear
    summary: "..."
    takeaways: "..."
    archive_status: "resolved"
```

**Ledger**

* Appends a ledger entry (type: `artifact`) with an inline ref to the snapshot.
  Capacity enforced by `policy.cap.ledger_max`.

**Errors**

* Open fractures → `tool.error { code: "E_PRECONDITION" }`
* Payload schema violation → `tool.error { code: "E_PAYLOAD" }`
* Ledger at cap → `tool.error { code: "E_QUOTA" }`

---

### 3) `closure.waiting_with` — active containment for unresolved tensions

**Preconditions**

* `len(meta_locus.review_queue) > 0`.
* Sets `meta_locus.containment = true`; auto-clears via `70_state` when queue empties.

**Payload schema**

```json
{
  "$id": "potm.kernel.closure.waiting_with.payload.v1",
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["wait_reason","reentry_hint"],
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "wait_reason":  { "type": "string", "minLength": 1, "maxLength": 256 },
    "reentry_hint": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1, "maxLength": 64 }
  }
}
```

**Success emission**

```yaml
tool.emit:
  id: "closure.waiting_with"
  ok: true
  result:
    wait_reason: "<echo>"
    reentry_hint: "<echo>"
```

**Ledger**

* Appends a ledger entry (type: `move`) capturing containment start + hints.
  Capacity enforced by `policy.cap.ledger_max`.

**Errors**

* No open fractures → `tool.error { code: "E_PRECONDITION" }`
* Payload schema violation → `tool.error { code: "E_PAYLOAD" }`
* Ledger at cap (rare here) → `tool.error { code: "E_QUOTA" }`

---

## Data Annexes (read-only, optional)

* `ANNEX:FRACTURE_TAXONOMY_MINI` (P1-MIN; improves spiral wording)
* `ANNEX:FRACTURE_TAXONOMY` (P1-ALL, if present)
* `ANNEX:FRACTURE_CROSSWALK` (optional)
* `ANNEX:FRACTURE_META_UNITY` (optional)

> Annexes refine labels only; absence must not change tool behavior.

---

## Examples

**Spiral (default scope)**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "closure.spiral"
  payload: {}
# → tool.emit { ok:true, result:{ diff_log:"..." } }
```

**Archive with specific fields**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "closure.archive"
  payload:
    include: ["summary","archive_status"]
# pre: len(meta_locus.review_queue) == 0
# → tool.emit { ok:true, result:{ summary:"...", archive_status:"resolved" } }
```

**Enter waiting\_with**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "closure.waiting_with"
  payload:
    wait_reason: "Spiking heat; unresolved value conflict"
    reentry_hint: "OpenQ after sleep"
# pre: len(meta_locus.review_queue) > 0
# → tool.emit { ok:true, result:{ ... } }; meta_locus.containment = true
```

---

## Failure Modes (router-aligned)

| condition                               | emission code    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| payload fails schema                    | `E_PAYLOAD`      |
| open fractures on `closure.archive`     | `E_PRECONDITION` |
| `waiting_with` without open fracture    | `E_PRECONDITION` |
| ledger buffer full during ledger append | `E_QUOTA`        |

---

## Versioning & Change Log

* **1.6.0-dev**: Initial P1 spec for `closure.spiral`, `closure.archive`, `closure.waiting_with`; router-aligned errors; state-gated preconditions; policy-gated caps; idempotent outputs.

# Latency Contract (85)

## Purpose
To define **operating guarantees** for responsiveness in PoTM kernel execution.  
Practitioners must not be forced into multi-minute waits.  
Latency rules are **binding invariants**, not optional optimizations.  

---

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

| Mode      | p50 Target | p95 Ceiling | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Lite**      | ≤ 2s       | ≤ 4s        | Onboarding, everyday dialogue |
| **Standard**  | ≤ 4s       | ≤ 6s        | Default practice; moderate checks allowed |
| **Strict**    | ≤ 8s       | ≤ 12s       | All tripwires active; practitioner explicitly opts in |

---

## Fast-Path Invariants

Only these checks run **every single turn**, across all modes:

1. **Agreement Accepted** — contract still intact.  
2. **Validator.stub** — schema + cheap invariants.  

Everything else must be gated by **mode** or **trigger**.  

---

## Cadence Rules

- **Fracture Finder** → every 5 turns or when epistemic load escalates.  
- **Mirror Protocol** → periodic (default every 10 turns) or on practitioner request.  
- **Guardian Tripwires** → only in `strict` unless triggered by high-risk cues.  
- **BS-Detect** → never automatic; only `strict` or by explicit practitioner cue.  

---

## Observability

Compliance with this contract must be externally checkable.  
The kernel exposes a dedicated read-only lens:

- `lens.latency_status` → returns the current `latency_mode` and the most recent
  `latency_breach` entry from `ledger_buffer`.

Example:

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "lens.latency_status"
  payload: {}
# → { "mode": "standard",
#      "last_breach": {
#         "ts": "2025-08-28T15:15:00Z",
#         "observed_latency": 7.1,
#         "ceiling": 6.0,
#         "severity": "warning"
#       } }
```

---

## Exception Handling

- **Integrity Overrides Performance**: If a red-level dignity or containment breach is suspected, SLOs may be violated.  
- **Practitioner Consent**: Escalation to `strict` must be explicit.  
- **Disclosure**: If latency exceeds SLO ceilings, system must announce cause (“Running extended fracture audit…”).  

---

## Versioning & Change Log
- **v1.0 (2025-08-28)** — Initial draft, integrated into kernel canon as 85.

id: potm.kernel.policy.v1_0_dev
title: "90_policy"
display_title: "Policy Tools"
type: kernel
lifecycle: canon
version: 1.0.0-dev
status: active
stability: stable
summary: >-
  Defines P1 policy enforcement tools for session-level content governance:
  policy.query (compliance check), policy.enforce (action application), and
  policy.report (violation summary). All are deterministic, session-local,
  and export-gated.
author: practitioner
license: CC0-1.0
---

## Overview

Policy tools govern content and actions at the session level.

- scope: session-local only
- I/O: none (no filesystem/network)
- determinism: true (pure function of state + payload)
- invocation: via `tool.call`
- emissions: `tool.emit` on success, `tool.error` on failure
- failure mode: fail-closed

The router enforces the **envelope caps** (see `40_router.md`). Policy adds
**content caps** and **action rules** that tools can check/apply.

---

## Invocation Grammar

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "policy.<tool_name>"
  payload: { ... }   # per-tool schema
````

`<tool_name>` ∈ { `query`, `enforce`, `report` }.

## Cap Table (content limits — single source of truth

These caps are enforced by `policy.*` tools and referenced by other specs.

```yaml
policy.cap:
  ledger_max:         512   # max entries in ledger_buffer
  diff_log_max:       400   # chars for closure.spiral.result.diff_log
  summary_max:        320   # chars for closure.archive.result.summary
  takeaways_max:      240   # chars for closure.archive.result.takeaways
  wait_reason_max:    256   # chars for closure.waiting_with.payload.wait_reason
  reentry_hint_max:    64   # chars for closure.waiting_with.payload.reentry_hint
```

---

## Violation Codes (policy-local; not router errors)

* `V_FIELD_TOO_LONG` — value exceeds cap for its target field
* `V_LEDGER_CAP` — ledger\_buffer at/over `policy.cap.ledger_max`
* `V_EXPORT_DISABLED` — kernel export not permitted (kernel never exports)
* `V_UNKNOWN_TARGET` — target not recognized by policy
* `V_UNSAFE_ACTION` — action not allowed in kernel context

> Router-level failures still use `E_*` codes (e.g., `E_PAYLOAD`, `E_PRECONDITION`, `E_QUOTA`, `E_DISABLED`, `E_INVARIANT`).

---

## Targets (what policy evaluates)

```yaml
policy.targets:
  - "spiral.diff_log"
  - "archive.summary"
  - "archive.takeaways"
  - "archive.archive_status"
  - "waiting_with.wait_reason"
  - "waiting_with.reentry_hint"
  - "ledger.append"          # capacity check (no value needed)
  - "export.request"         # always blocked in-kernel
```

---

## Tools & Behavior

### 1) policy.query — check a candidate against caps/rules

**Preconditions**

* `meta_locus.accepted == true`

**Payload**

* `target`: one of `policy.targets`
* `value`: optional string content (required for all targets except `ledger.append`)

**Behavior**

* Validates the target/value against caps and rules.
* Returns `violations: []` (possibly empty). No state changes; no ledger writes.

**Result**

* `violations`: array of `{ code, reason }`
* `decision`: `"allow" | "revise" | "block"` (advisory; `policy.enforce` makes the binding decision)
* `suggest`: optional sanitized string (e.g., truncated to cap) when a simple revision is sufficient

---

### 2) policy.enforce — apply policy to a candidate

**Preconditions**

* `meta_locus.accepted == true`

**Payload**

* Same shape as `policy.query`.

**Behavior**

* Applies deterministic enforcement:

  * For length violations → `decision:"revise"` and `value_out` truncated to cap.
  * For `export.request` → `decision:"block"`.
  * For `ledger.append` when buffer full → `decision:"block"`.
  * If `decision != "allow"` and ledger has capacity, append a **move** entry.
  * If at capacity, do not attempt append; return `side_effects.ledger:"skipped_cap"`
    and include a router-level `warnings:["ledger at cap — policy entry not recorded"]`.

**Result**

* `decision`: `"allow" | "revise" | "block"`
* `violations`: array as above
* `value_out`: (present on `revise`) sanitized string
* `cap`: numeric cap used for the target (for transparency)

**Errors**

* Schema invalid → `E_PAYLOAD`
* Any unexpected state constraint (should not occur in P1) → `E_INVARIANT`
* Ledger full when trying to record the enforcement move → `E_QUOTA`
  (Note: enforcement still returns its decision; the ledger append error is surfaced separately.)

---

### 3) policy.report — summarize policy activity this session

**Preconditions**

* `meta_locus.accepted == true`

**Payload**

* Optional: `scope: "session"` (default)

**Behavior**

* Scans `ledger_buffer` for refs with `#policy:` and returns counts by decision & code.
* Does not mutate state.

**Result**

* `totals`: `{ allow, revise, block }`
* `by_code`: `{ V_FIELD_TOO_LONG: n, V_LEDGER_CAP: n, ... }`
* `last`: array (≤ 10) of recent policy refs `{ ts, decision, code }`

---

## Failure Modes (router-aligned)

| condition                               | emission code    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| payload fails schema                    | `E_PAYLOAD`      |
| precondition not met (`accepted=false`) | `E_PRECONDITION` |
| ledger append during enforce hits cap   | `E_QUOTA`        |

---

## Examples

**Query: archive summary within cap**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "policy.query"
  payload:
    target: "archive.summary"
    value: "Short and sweet."
# → tool.emit { result:{ decision:"allow", violations:[] } }
```

**Enforce: spiral diff\_log too long**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "policy.enforce"
  payload:
    target: "spiral.diff_log"
    value: "<405 chars ...>"
# → decision:"revise", violations:[{code:"V_FIELD_TOO_LONG"}], value_out:"<trimmed to 400>"
# → ledger append: ref "#policy:revise:V_FIELD_TOO_LONG"
```

**Query: ledger capacity before append**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "policy.query"
  payload:
    target: "ledger.append"
# → if at cap: decision:"block", violations:[{code:"V_LEDGER_CAP"}]
```

**Enforce: export request (blocked in-kernel)**

```yaml
tool.call:
  id: "policy.enforce"
  payload:
    target: "export.request"
    value: "any"
# → decision:"block", violations:[{code:"V_EXPORT_DISABLED"}]
```

## Cap Resolver (pure helper)

Resolves a policy *target* to its enforcement rule and (if applicable) numeric cap
from `policy.cap`. Not a public tool; used internally by `policy.query` and `policy.enforce`.

### Mapping table

```yaml
policy.cap.table:
  spiral.diff_log:           { cap_key: diff_log_max,     rule: clamp }
  archive.summary:           { cap_key: summary_max,      rule: clamp }
  archive.takeaways:         { cap_key: takeaways_max,    rule: clamp }
  archive.archive_status:    { cap_key: null,             rule: enum }       # enum handled by caller
  waiting_with.wait_reason:  { cap_key: wait_reason_max,  rule: clamp }
  waiting_with.reentry_hint:

---

## `tool.index` additions

```yaml
tool.index:
  - id: policy.query
    payload_schema_ref: "spec/policy.query.payload.v1.json"
    result_schema_ref:  "spec/policy.query.result.v1.json"

# Latency Diagnostic

## Purpose
To **measure and profile execution time** of kernel components, protocols, and diagnostics in order to identify bottlenecks.  
This diagnostic supports enforcement of the **Latency Contract (85)** by revealing which subsystems exceed the service level objectives (SLOs).  

---

## When to Run
- After integrating new kernel/protocol code.  
- When observed latency approaches or exceeds SLO ceilings.  
- Periodically (e.g. once per release cycle) as part of extended self-diagnostic routines.  

---

## Inputs

- Current kernel mode (`lite`, `standard`, `strict`), read from `meta_locus.latency_mode`.
- Observed timing data captured per turn or per invocation.
- **Lens feed:** `lens.latency_status` is the canonical source for:
  - Current `latency_mode`
  - Most recent `latency_breach` entry in `ledger_buffer`

---

## Procedure
1. **Instrument** each major component (agreement, validator, fracture_finder, mirror, guardian, bs_detect).
2. **Record runtime** for each invocation in milliseconds/seconds, and query
   `lens.latency_status` to cross-check the current mode and most recent breach.
3. **Aggregate** timing data by:
   - p50 (median)  
   - p95 (worst-case ceiling)  
   - outliers (any run >2× SLO target).  
4. **Compare** against Latency Contract SLOs.  
5. **Classify** each component as:
   - ✅ within bounds,  
   - ⚠ borderline,  
   - ❌ violating.  
6. **Log results** into the extended diagnostics ledger.  

---

## Decision Rules
- If any ❌ component is core (agreement, validator) →

## Artifacts

- Latency profile table (per component).
- Comparative report vs. Latency Contract (85).
- Suggested cadence adjustments.
- Extract from `lens.latency_status` showing mode and last breach at time of run.

Great — here’s a **mock diagnostic output table** you can drop at the end of
`extended/diagnostics/latency_diagnostic.md` under **Examples**.
It shows how a run would look if you queried `lens.latency_status`, timed a few checks, and compared against the contract.

---

## Examples

### Example Run (2025-08-28)

**lens.latency_status**

```yaml
{
  "mode": "standard",
  "last_breach": {
    "ts": "2025-08-28T15:15:00Z",
    "observed_latency": 7.1,
    "ceiling": 6.0,
    "severity": "warning"
  }
}
````

**Component Timing Profile**

| Component          | Median (p50) | 95th (p95) | Contract Ceiling | Status                          |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| agreement.accepted | 0.01s        | 0.02s      | ≤ 6s             | ✅ within bounds                 |
| validator.stub     | 0.12s        | 0.20s      | ≤ 6s             | ✅ within bounds                 |
| fracture\_finder   | 1.5s         | 4.8s       | ≤ 6s             | ⚠ borderline (close to ceiling) |
| mirror\_protocol   | 2.1s         | 7.1s       | ≤ 6s             | ❌ breach (logged to ledger)     |
| guardian check     | 1.8s         | 3.5s       | ≤ 6s             | ✅ within bounds                 |

**Summary**

* **1 warning** (`fracture_finder` borderline at 4.8s).
* **1 breach** (`mirror_protocol` exceeded 6s ceiling, logged via `move.log_latency_breach`).
* Latency mode = `standard`.
* Contract SLO (≤ 6s p95) violated once; router emitted `W_LATENCY_BREACH`.
