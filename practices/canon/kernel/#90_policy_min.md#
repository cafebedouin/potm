# Policy — Minimal Caps

## 0) Scope

- Defines only **caps** required by kernel validators and state:
  - latency ceilings (p50/p95 by mode)
  - maximum ledger size
- Everything else is governed by extended/ policy modules.

## 1) Latency ceilings

Enforced by `potm.kernel.latency.validator.min.v1_6_dev`.  
Source of truth is `potm.latency.cap.min.v1_6_dev`.
