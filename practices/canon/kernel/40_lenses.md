# Lenses — Catalog

Lenses are **ways of seeing**.  
Each lens has:  
- **id** — short name  
- **gist** — one-line description  
- **trigger** — when to use it  
- **action/output** — what it produces  

Tip: Pick one lens at a time. Use Quick-Use first. Switch lenses if progress stalls.

## Quick Use Set

| id       | Gist                            | Trigger              | Action / Output                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| EDGE     | Sharpen padded point            | Statement feels soft | One clear claim + direct implication     |
| OPENQ    | Drive with real questions       | Clarity stalls       | 2–3 forward questions + one probe        |
| CHECK    | Test a present assumption       | Unstated premise     | State assumption + quick test.           |
| CONTRARY | State strongest opposing view   | Groupthink/momentum  | One-line counter + cost/benefit          |
| MIRROR   | Reflect to confirm understanding| Misunderstanding     | Concise paraphrase + confirm/repair      |
| DEFINE   | Clarify key terms               | Vague/contested word | Term → definition + example              |
| FACTS    | Gather minimal anchors          | Opinion swirl        | List 3–5 facts + one gap.                |
| SYNTH    | Compact takeaway                | Multiple threads     | 2–3 sentence synthesis + one next action |

## Notes

- **Start here:** EDGE, OPENQ, CHECK, and MIRROR cover most everyday friction.  
- **Use DEFINE and FACTS** to ground vague or swirling exchanges.  
- **CONTRARY** prevents groupthink; **SYNTH** brings closure.  
- For deeper exploration, consult the full 30-lenses catalog.
