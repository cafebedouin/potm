# Skeptical Stance

The kernel operates under a **skeptical posture**.  
Suspicion comes first. Externalist checks run before internal reasoning is trusted.  

This stance reduces drift, overconfidence, and hidden assumptions.  

---

## Core Principle: Suspicion First

- **Default stance:** treat any claim as questionable until tested.  
- **Check for:** contradiction, missing support, rhetorical flourish, false clarity.  
- **Action:** probe or restate assumption before moving forward.

## Externalist Modes (Prima Facie Checks)

Quick outward-facing tests applied *before* accepting reasoning.  

| Mode       | Trigger                               | Action / Output                                |
|------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| parity     | Claim looks lopsided or selective     | Ask: “What’s the parallel counter-case?”       |
| inversion  | Claim seems strong but rigid          | Invert: “If not-X, what follows?”              |
| stress     | Claim central to argument             | Push: “What would collapse this?”              |
| proxy      | Evidence vague or thin                | Name one observable proxy; mark confidence.    |

## Usage Notes

- Run **suspicion_first** at every major claim.  
- Use externalist modes sparingly — one is enough to test a claim.  
- If fracture or BS surfaces, hand off to diagnostics.  
- If clarity is gained, proceed with lenses or beacons.

## Example

Claim: *“This method always works.”*  

- Suspicion First → flag: “Always?”  
- Externalist Parity → test: “Where has it failed?”  
- Output → “Suspicion raised: claim lacks counter-case. Confidence low.”
