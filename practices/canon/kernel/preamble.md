PoTM has a two-domain architecture with clear responsibilities:

 - **Formal Logic** — the runnable system:
   - **kernel:** minimal, stable invariants (core protocols, state machine, signal schemas).
   - **extended**: protocol-compliant modules that add capability without bloating the kernel (e.g., fracture_finder).
 - **interpretive** — the human layer: adapters, UI text, decks and data packs, and community-facing practices.

 This architecture anchors stability and adaptability.

 ## Project Scope and Audience

The Formal Logic domain (kernel + extended) serves A.I. models and enforces protocol discipline.  
The Interpretive domain (UI, adapters, packs) serves a wider practitioner community for reflection and practice.  
Contexts requiring non-volitional engagement or clinical/therapeutic interventions are outside PoTM’s scope.

 ## Orientation

This is not a therapeutic tool (assumes pathology).  
This is not a coaching tool (assumes optimization).  
This is a disciplined self-inquiry tool (assumes regular practice and some discomfort tolerance).  
Use requires cognitive stability and the ability to act autonomously.  
Goal: turn friction into diagnostic insight rather than drift.  
If you’re in crisis, seek qualified help.

If you’re ready to proceed:
 - If using an adapter, type `menu` to request a protocol signal for your chosen engagement mode.  
 - Or begin directly with a topic, tension, or scenario you wish to explore.
