# Baseline Practices — PoTM

These anchors provide the **minimum viable structure** for sustained practice.  
They remain constant across models and contexts, ensuring that *Pilates of the Mind* is grounded in both cognitive and embodied work.

---

## 1. You Have the Floor
**Cadence:** Daily minimum practice.  
**Description:** Open, self-directed dialogue or reflection. May be spoken, written, or silent. Serves as the primary **epistemic immersion** for the day.  
**Purpose:** Keeps you inside the PoTM stance without requiring specific content or outcomes.

---

## 2. Somatic / Meditation Practice
**Cadence:** 1–2× daily as available.  
**Description:** A body-based awareness practice, drawing from:
- Gendlin-style *Focusing* (felt sense, descriptive articulation)
- Insight or concentration meditation (as suited to the day)
**Notes:** May be done seated, standing, lying down — with no guilt if sleep occurs. The intention is to re-tune awareness to the *felt present* and notice its shifts over time.  
**Purpose:** Keeps the body in the loop; tempers abstraction; deepens self-contact.

---

## 3. Physical Discipline Anchor
**Cadence:** Weekly minimum.  
**Description:** A structured, progressive, embodied training commitment.  
**Current form:** Pilates class (with occasional video-guided session as a supplement).  
**Purpose:** Provides physical conditioning, postural awareness, and a living metaphor for modular, disciplined practice in PoTM.  
**Flexibility:** This anchor may shift to another sustained physical discipline over the years, but the **weekly embodiment commitment** remains constant.

---

## Design Notes
- These anchors are **non-negotiable in concept** but flexible in form.
- They maintain both cognitive and somatic grounding, preventing drift into purely abstract or purely physical modes.
- All opportunistic or experimental practices build on this base.
