# 📓 Journal Practice README

## Overview
Journaling in PoTM is a **structured reflection practice**: writing that balances exploration with synthesis.  
It creates an accumulating record of insight, patterns, and growth. Entries may be short (3–5 minutes) or extended (20+ minutes).

---

## Current Approaches
- **Three-Question Format** ✍️ — What happened? What did I learn? What’s next?  
- **Domain Rotation** 🔄 — cycle focus between body, emotions, mind, relationships  
- **Gratitude + Growth** 🌱 — appreciation paired with challenge identification  
- **Weekly Reviews** 📅 — synthesis of themes across daily entries  

---

## How to Use
- **Morning Pages** 🌅 — unfiltered stream-of-consciousness to clear mental space  
- **Evening Reflection** 🌙 — structured review of the day’s experiences  
- **Prompt-Driven** ❓ — use PoTM journal prompts to target specific themes  
- **Free-Form** 🌀 — write when a topic insists on attention  

---

## Complementary Practices
These extend journaling into other reflective modalities, linked to *Finding Your Best Starting Point* categories:

- **Body Log** 🏋️ — PT tests, sleep notes, energy ratings  
- **Emotion Diary** 💓 — mood graphs, “3 feelings” list, triggers/resolutions  
- **Mind Sketches** 🧠 — diagrams, thought-maps, problem decompositions  
- **Relationship Journaling** 🤝 — conversations, patterns, conflicts, appreciations  
- **Dream Log** 🌌 — recording unconscious material  

---

## Orientation Guides
Journaling sits within a broader ecosystem. See also:

- 🌍 [Finding Your Best Starting Point](../../practitioners/human/guides/finding_best_starting_point.md) — to decide whether structured or open-ended journaling is best  
- 🗺️ [Preventive Atlas](../../meta/preventive_atlas.md) — to notice when journal themes point to larger domains of drift  

---

## Feedback Loops
- Journaling can surface patterns for Atlas review  
- Entries can seed Zuihitsu fragments  
- Identified tensions may guide card or meditation selection  

---

## Temporal Rhythm
- **Daily**: short entry (3–10 minutes)  
- **Weekly**: review for themes and shifts  
- **Seasonal**: cross-check journal patterns against Atlas domains

### Lineage
- **Forge origin**: Integration design for reflective practice coherence  
- **Spiral evaluation**: Draft refined via Pal review for repo readiness
