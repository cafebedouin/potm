# 🧘 Meditation Practice README

## Overview
Meditation in PoTM is a family of **contemplative practices** that cultivate attention, clarity, and equanimity.  
They include both **formal sits** (5–45 minutes) and **micro-meditations** woven into daily life.  

---

## Current Protocols
- 🌬️ [Breath Awareness](./meditation_breath_awareness.md) — concentration practice, breath as anchor  
- 🫁 [Body Scan](./meditation_body_scan.md) — systematic somatic awareness  
- 🏷️ [Noting Practice](./meditation_noting.md) — Daniel Ingram–style rapid labeling of phenomena  
- 👁️ [Open Monitoring](./meditation_open_monitoring.md) — equanimous observation of all arising experience  

---

## How to Use
- **Daily Sits** 🪷 — choose one protocol for 5–45 minutes  
- **Micro-Meditations** ⚡ — short pauses (10–60 seconds) to reset attention  
- **Crisis Support** 🛡️ — use noting or breath awareness when overwhelmed  
- **Retreat Periods** ⛺ — deepen with extended practice sessions  

---

## Complementary Practices
Meditation connects with and amplifies other PoTM modalities:

- **Somatic Practices** 🤲 — grounding, posture reset, tension release  
- **Contemplative Reading** 📖 — reading with sustained, meditative attention  
- **Relational Awareness** 💞 — bringing presence into dialogue or role play  
- **Nature Practice** 🌳 — anchoring awareness in natural environments  

---

## Orientation Guides
Meditation should be placed in context. See also:

- 🌍 [Finding Your Best Starting Point](../commentary/human/guides/finding_best_starting_point.md) — helps decide if meditation is today’s smart, fun, or hard move  
- 🗺️ [Preventive Atlas](../../meta/preventive_atlas.md) — ensures meditation is balanced with broader health and life maintenance  

---

## Feedback Loops
- Meditation stabilizes attention for journaling and zuihitsu  
- Body scan prepares for somatic cards and check-ins  
- Noting surfaces patterns that can be logged and later checked against Atlas domains  

---

## Temporal Rhythm
- **Daily**: 1 short sit or micro-meditation  
- **Weekly**: 1 longer sit (30–60 minutes) or group practice  
- **Seasonal**: retreat day or weekend deep dive  

---

### Lineage
- **Forge origin**: PoTM integration of concentration and insight practices (including Daniel Ingram’s noting)  
- **Spiral evaluation**: Draft refined via Pal review for repo readiness
