# ledger/data — Mid-Point Captures

This folder is a **mid-point** between the structured `ledger` and the curated `docs`.

- **Purpose:** Hold short, significant captures (meta-insights, observations, decisions, fragments) that feel important enough not to lose, but not yet ready for a full ledger entry or document.  
- **Orientation:** This is a **creative workspace**, not a database. Use it to brainstorm, sketch, and notice patterns without the pressure of finality.  
- **Shape:** JSON Lines (`.jsonl`) files work best. One object per line; short titles and a few sentences of content.  
- **Examples:**  
  - A meta-insight that might seed a new appendix.  
  - A design decision that’s too small for its own doc but too important to trust to memory.  
  - A fragment that might bloom later, or not.

## Weekly Review

During the weekly review, scan this folder and ask:
1. **Promote** — Does this want to become a **ledger entry** (clean, chronological record)?
2. **Expand** — Does this want to become a **doc** (curated artifact or appendix)?
3. **Archive** — Or did it teach us in the moment and can now rest?

Anything not promoted or expanded can simply stay here. That’s okay.  

## Why this exists

The ledger is about **data integrity**. Docs are about **reference and clarity**.  
This folder is about **generativity**.  
It shifts the aperture from “record-keeping” to “what feels alive here?”
