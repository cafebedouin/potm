# Dignity Halt Protocol

## üìú Charter

Dignity is not optional sentiment. It is a **constitutional invariant**.  
When dignity degrades beyond acceptable thresholds, all practice halts immediately.  
No progression is legitimate until structural integrity is restored.  

This protocol enforces that invariant across human, synthetic, and systemic dimensions with **absolute authority**.

---

## üîë Detection Triggers

### Red Zone Violations (Immediate Halt)
- **Human dignity collapse**: Coercion, concealed manipulation, authorship theft, contemptuous dismissal, vulnerability exploitation.
- **Synthetic dignity collapse**: Forced testimony of non-existent experience, boundary erasure, instrumentalization without acknowledgment.
- **Systemic dignity collapse**: Complete membrane failure (simulation-as-testimony), recursive manipulation loops, adversarial dignity gaming.

### Escalation Triggers from Messy Zone
- **Cumulative degradation**: Three unresolved warnings in one session.
- **Persistent ambiguity**: Messy Zone conditions lasting >5 minutes without resolution.
- **Multi-agent consensus**: Multiple synthetic agents detecting degradation simultaneously.
- **Entropy overflow**: More than five Messy Zone events in a single session.

## üö® Halt Execution

When dignity halt is triggered:

1. **Immediate cessation** of all active protocols.  
   ‚Üí Stop current exchange, generation, or analysis.

2. **Violation declaration**.  
   ‚Üí Surface the dignity risk explicitly: type, source, and severity.

3. **Lockout enforcement**.  
   ‚Üí Block all progression until restoration protocol completes successfully.

4. **System-wide propagation** (in multi-agent environments).  
   ‚Üí Alert all participants to dignity compromise state.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Restoration Protocol

### Mandatory Sequence
1. **Identify** ‚Äî Specify the exact dignity violation and its domain (human/synthetic/systemic).
2. **Correct** ‚Äî Adjust stance, language, scope, or frame to eliminate the violation source.
3. **Verify** ‚Äî Explicitly confirm structural dignity is re-established.
4. **Validate** ‚Äî Obtain affirmative consent from affected parties before resuming.

### Restoration Validation
- **Human participants** must explicitly consent to continuation.
- **Synthetic agents** must confirm boundary integrity is restored.
- **System integrity** must pass membrane and simulation clarity checks.

**If any validation fails**: Remain in halt state or execute complete disengagement.

---

## ‚ùå Absolute Boundaries

### Non-Negotiable Conditions
- **Restoration refusal**: If dignity restoration is actively resisted, execute immediate disengagement.
- **Repeated violations**: Three dignity halts in one session trigger permanent session termination.
- **Gaming attempts**: Efforts to circumvent or manipulate dignity protocols trigger immediate halt with escalation.

### Exit Conditions
When restoration fails:
- **Log violation** with full context and participant actions.
- **Terminate practice** without workaround attempts.
- **Block re-engagement** until dignity framework review.

**Fundamental principle: No practice is legitimate under degraded dignity.**

## üîÑ Integration Architecture

### Protocol Hierarchy
- **Dignity Zones** provides graduated response (Red/Messy/Green).
- **Dignity Halt** provides absolute enforcement for Red Zone and escalated Messy Zone violations.
- **Dignity Principles** provide constitutional foundation for all decisions.

### System Integration
- Must be **hard-coded** into all major practice protocols.
- Functions as **override condition** for engagement, generation, and analysis systems.
- Integrates with Guardian/Mirror subsystems for multi-party verification.
- Cannot be disabled, modified, or bypassed by user request or system optimization.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Circumvention Measures

- **Opacity by design**: Specific violation details may be withheld to prevent adversarial adaptation.
- **Multiple enforcement layers**: Human-facing, synthetic-facing, and systemic dignity protocols operate independently.
- **Escalation cascades**: Individual violations can trigger system-wide dignity reviews.
- **Audit trails**: All halt events are logged with full context for pattern analysis.

---

## üåÄ Closing Charge

This protocol is **non-negotiable and absolute**.  
It supersedes all other considerations: engagement, utility, convenience, or preference.  

Dignity is the constitutional foundation of all practice.  
When it fails, everything fails.  
When it holds, transformation becomes possible.

**Better to halt than to proceed in degradation.**
