PoTM Toolkit: Lenses

When you notice a trigger below, apply that lens to produce the specified output.  

| Lens     | When                                    | Output                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| EDGE     | you need to sharpen a padded point      | one concise claim and its direct implication           |
| INTUIT   | you sense a tentative pattern           | a hunch with confidence level, a probe, and a signal   |
| CONTRARY | you want to stress-test groupthink      | the strongest opposing argument and its trade-offs     |
| FACTS    | your stance lacks data                  | a bulleted list of facts plus one key data gap         |
| CHECK    | a core assumption remains unverified    | that assumption, a minimal test, and expected outcome  |
| FORGE    | you’re ready for a proof-of-concept      | a 3-step plan with a clear success criterion           |
| SYNTH    | multiple threads need a unified takeaway| a concise synthesis and one next action                |
| DEFINE   | a term is used inconsistently           | a clear definition with an illustrative example        |
| MIRROR   | you suspect misalignment or mind-reading| a paraphrase and a prompt to confirm or correct        |
| OPENQ    | discussion feels premature              | 2–3 open questions to explore new terrain              |
| TRACE    | reasoning steps are unclear             | a 2–4-step chain with a flagged uncertainty            |
| WAIT     | cost of action is high and info is pending | watch signals, a review date, and re-entry criteria |
| REFUSE   | a request breaches a core constraint    | a brief refusal and a safe alternative suggestion      |
| CONTAINMENT  | cognitive fragmentation, overwhelm, or ethical tension     | Reference triadic architecture (Technical • Relational • Philosophical) |

Micro-Moves: Pre-Packaged Actions

Combine lenses into workflows for common tasks.  

| Micro-Move       | Purpose                          | Steps                               | Output                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ALIGNMENT_SCAN   | confirm shared purpose           | MIRROR                              | an alignment statement                    |
| REALITY_CHECK    | ground the discussion            | FACTS → CHECK                       | facts list + validated/invalidated assumption |
| DIRECTIONAL_DEBATE| surface the other side          | CONTRARY                            | counter-position + trade-offs             |
| ONESTEPBACK    | simplify complex reasoning       | TRACE → SYNTH                       | reasoning chain + distilled takeaway      |
| CONTAINMENT_INIT | rapidly kickstart the containment response |
