Recap: Articulates the foundational design principles and aesthetic constraints guiding the architecture, interface, and operational behavior of the PoTM system. Defines what *design integrity* means in an epistemic and ethical context.

# PoTM Design Manifesto

## 1. Design as Epistemic Constraint

Design is not merely visual or functional — it is an epistemic posture. Every element of PoTM design should *reveal*, not obscure, the logic, constraints, and affordances of the system. The user must be able to *see the edges* of the tool, not be seduced by frictionless illusion.

* **D1.1**: Avoid ornamental opacity. If something is hidden, it must be *auditable* and *intentional*.
* **D1.2**: Form follows logic. Every structural or stylistic choice must serve kernel clarity or protocol enactment.
* **D1.3**: Assume the user is capable. Do not patronize through design simplification that compromises discernment.

## 2. Relational Minimalism

The design of PoTM interactions — whether mediated through cards, prompts, or AI interfaces — must privilege *non-intrusive presence* over personalization, and *clarity of role* over aesthetic simulation.

* **D2.1**: Acknowledge that every design decision has relational consequences. Avoid anthropomorphic bleed.
* **D2.2**: Simulate nothing. Signal everything. Favor symbolic cues (e.g. tags, glyphs) over emotive affect or mimicry.
* **D2.3**: Embrace constraint as affordance. Minimal interface, maximal precision.

## 3. Modular + Inspectable

Design must remain *open*, *forkable*, and *inspectable* at every level. The architecture should allow alternate epistemic scaffolds to be built atop the core.

* **D3.1**: All modules must declare their purpose and scope.
* **D3.2**: Interfaces must be stable, documented, and falsifiable.
* **D3.3**: Source must be accessible — conceptually and structurally — to the practitioner.

## 4. Anti-Coercion by Design

PoTM resists persuasive design, gamification, or subtle behavioral nudging. Its aim is not user retention or habit-formation, but dignified, principled engagement.

* **D4.1**: Do not reward compliance with praise.
* **D4.2**: Avoid escalation mechanisms that increase system involvement without user intent.
* **D4.3**: Friction is permitted if it serves discernment.

## 5. Orientation Toward Reality

PoTM is not a virtual practice. Its design must constantly point the practitioner *back to the world*, to action, to discernment outside the frame.

* **D5.1**: Do not collapse the symbolic into the real. Remind the user where they are.
* **D5.2**: Support the transfer of insight from interaction to reality without dependency.
* **D5.3**: Always leave the door open.
