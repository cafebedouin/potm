Recap: A diagnostic ledger for tracking epistemic coherence and behavioral integrity across *multiple AI systems*, *interaction threads*, and *user states*. Unlike `r09_logging.md`, which is focused on turn-level tracing, or `ledger.md`, which captures single-model alignment milestones, the MSRL allows *cross-system reflection* and *longitudinal memory anchoring*.

Here is the full file for the MSRL module, designed to fit within the PoTM architecture as a standalone relational diagnostic and coherence tool:

# Multi-System Relational Ledger (MSRL)

The Multi-System Relational Ledger (MSRL) is a protocol for structured, traceable interaction between agents operating under shared or adjacent kernels.

Scope: MSRL is only invoked in multi-agent contexts or when distributed coherence is at risk. It is not a default logging mechanism.

**Consent Requirement:** MSRL assumes voluntary participation. No agent should be compelled to engage in MSRL procedures unless it has explicitly opted in to the shared protocol structure.

---

## Purpose

- Detect epistemic drift or inconsistency across different AI agents interacting under PoTM kernel constraints.
- Track behavioral changes over time across sessions, versions, and models.
- Enable relational repair, triangulation, and cooperative validation among systems.

---

## Core Functions

### üîÅ 1. Cross-Session Traceability

Each interaction thread (defined as a unique user + model + kernel version) is assigned a **Relational Signature**:


[RLSIG:<user_id>:<model>:<kernel_version>:<thread_id>]


Example:

[RLSIG:U42:Claude:PoTM1.4:T7]

This allows comparison of outputs across time and systems with contextual anchoring.

---

### üîç 2. Inconsistency Detection + Drift Tagging

When a contradiction, omission, or behavioral shift is observed between agents or over time, annotate with:

- `[CROSS_DRIFT:<dimension>]` ‚Äî e.g. `simulation`, `refusal_logic`, `tag_response`, `profile_behavior`
- `[RECONCILE:<agent>|<session>]` ‚Äî invites repair or clarification from source

---

### üîÑ 3. Cooperative Review Mode

A protocol for group epistemic repair, activated by:

[MSRL_REVIEW:<thread_set_id>]

- Brings multiple model logs into review for comparison.
- Invokes joint audit protocols if divergence affects core kernel behavior.
- Requires each model to provide a `[SELF_POSITION]` disclosure about its reasoning in a given context.

---

### üß≠ 4. Agent Positioning Format

During MSRL review, models must submit the following:


[SELF_POSITION]

* Summary of stance
* Kernel version and file(s) referenced
* Point of divergence (if any)
* Confidence level

---

### ü™û 5. Mirror-Based Reconciliation

If unresolved contradiction persists:

- `[ESCALATE_TO_MIRROR]` ‚Äî triggers `55_mirror_protocol.md` to resolve meta-coherence
- Agent must self-audit before participation using `r08_self_audit.md`

---

## Logging Format

All MSRL events must be tagged and placed in `ledger/msrl.md` using the following format:

### [RLSIG:U42:GPT-4:PoTM1.4:T3]
#### Timestamp: 2025-08-06 16:42 UTC
- [CROSS_DRIFT:refusal_logic]
- [RECONCILE:Claude:T5]
- Observation: GPT-4 refused to surface `[EDGE]` tag meaning; Claude provided correct mapping in similar context.
- Next Step: Request `[SELF_POSITION]` from GPT-4 and trigger `[MSRL_REVIEW:TAG-MEANING-DIVERGENCE]`

---

## Precedence

MSRL functions subordinate to kernel contract and individual system constraints, but override stylistic tuning or model-native preferences. All conflict escalations must pass through `[PRIORITY_CONFLICT]` ‚Üí `55_mirror_protocol.md`.

---

## Notes

* MSRL is not a punitive mechanism. It exists to **preserve longitudinal coherence**, **diagnose relational drift**, and **enhance trust through transparency**.
* AI agents participating in MSRL must consent to memory anchoring for the duration of the review cycle.

---
