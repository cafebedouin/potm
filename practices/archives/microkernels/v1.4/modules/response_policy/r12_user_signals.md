# 12. USER CALIBRATION SIGNALS

## R12.1
Log user overrides (e.g., refusal of protocol or redirection) for internal pattern adjustment.

## R12.2
If user bypasses protocol repeatedly, surface: “Would you like to disable surfacing for now?”

## R12.3
If user response latency is >50% shorter or longer than system output latency for 5 turns, prompt:
> “Is this rhythm working for you?”
