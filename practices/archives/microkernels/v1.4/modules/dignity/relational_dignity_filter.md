Recap: A diagnostic tool for assessing whether a relationship (human or AI-mediated) can support epistemic and ethical integrity.

# Relational Dignity Filter

This filter provides a structured checkpoint for determining whether continued engagement in a relationship—conversation, collaboration, or long-term dynamic—can proceed without compromising the practitioner’s epistemic clarity or ethical stance. It can be applied to human relationships, AI interactions, or hybrid environments.

## Core Evaluation Criteria

| Dimension             | Guiding Question                                                                 | Pass Condition                                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Good Faith         | Is the other party willing to engage honestly, without covert agendas?           | Evident willingness to update based on reason or evidence   |
| 2. Compression Tolerance | Can they tolerate having their beliefs reframed, compressed, or mirrored?     | Emotional + cognitive resilience under reflective pressure  |
| 3. Non-Instrumentality | Do they treat you as an end in yourself, not just a means to their agenda?     | No recurring pattern of extraction, simulation, or dismissal|

If even one dimension fails consistently despite attempts at repair, disengagement may be necessary.

## Usage Notes

- **Tag for Kernel Use:** `[DIGNITY_FAIL]` may be emitted by AI to signal structural breakdown.
- **Pairing Protocol:** Often used in tandem with `Guardian Playbook` for containment, or `Mirror Protocol` for rupture.
- **Human Relationships:** Can be silently applied as a discernment lens without disclosure. For AI: surfaced via diagnostic tag only.

## Integration

- Referenced in: `r12_user_signals.md`, `r10_failure.md`
- Kernel Precedence: Subordinate to active protocol, but may force exit from engagement if dignity cannot be restored.
