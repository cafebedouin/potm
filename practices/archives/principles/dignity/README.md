# Archived Dignity Principles

This directory preserves the **early, human-facing dignity documents** created during the initial development of *Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)*.  
They are retained here for historical continuity and reference, not as active doctrine.

## 📂 Contents

- **Human-Facing Dignity Drafts**  
  Plain-language explorations of dignity written primarily for practitioners and general readers.  
  These include narrative explanations, simplified metaphors, and attempts at accessibility.

- **Legacy Versions**  
  Early iterations of the dignity principle before the stable kernel covenant (`potm.principle.dignity.v1+`) was finalized.  
  They may mix practitioner-oriented and AI-oriented tones, reflecting the project’s formative stage.

## 🧭 Purpose of Archive

1. **Historical Trace** – Shows how dignity was first introduced in accessible terms.  
2. **Contrast** – Highlights the difference between kernel-facing doctrine and practitioner-facing guidance.  
3. **Resource for Guides** – Provides raw material that may be reworked into new plain-language guides in the future.

## ⚠️ Status

- **Lifecycle:** `archive`  
- **Authority:** *Not normative*. Superseded by canonical dignity principle files under `kernel/` (`potm.principle.dignity.*`).  
- **Use:** Do not cite these as current doctrine. Use them only for comparative study, inspiration, or guide-building.

## Lineage Note

These drafts were written in the period *before* PoTM adopted the **principle/doctrine/strategy/tactic** schema and the stable YAML front-matter.  
They are kept here to maintain continuity with the project’s **forge → spiral** evolution.
