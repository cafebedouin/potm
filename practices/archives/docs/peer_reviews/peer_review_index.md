# ðŸ§­ Peer Review Index

This folder contains formal peer evaluations and authorial appendices for key components in the *Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) framework.

These reviews are not adjudications, but reflective instruments. Their purpose is to surface blind spots, validate coherence, and model epistemic humility. The inclusion of multiple AI peer perspectives alongside internal authorial rationale is meant to foster interpretive clarity and philosophical robustness.
