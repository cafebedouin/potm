# Fade Protocol (Gentle Dissolution)

## Purpose
Fade is the **soft immune response** of the system.  
Instead of piercing (stab), it gradually lets unused or unhelpful material return to the compost layer.  

Fade honors impermanence and metabolizes detritus without violence.  
It ensures that **what is alive remains**, while what no longer resonates gently passes.

---

## When to Run

### Individual-Level
- Fragments, cards, or practices once useful but now stale.  
- Behaviors that aren’t violations, but quietly **sap vitality**.  
- Journals or ledger entries no longer alive in practice.

### Community-Level
- Shared fragments that **haven’t been invoked** within a set interval.  
- Rituals or micro-protocols that feel hollow but not harmful.  
- Circles holding practices no longer aligned with their current season.

---

## Inputs
- Usage signal (decline or absence).  
- Guardian or circle noticing “flatness” or “drift without breach.”  
- Time interval or decay threshold (e.g. 90 days without invocation).  

---

## Procedure

### Individual-Level
1. **Notice**: Practitioner sees fragment no longer “stabs” or feels alive.  
2. **Name**: Mark as `status: faded`.  
3. **Compost**: Return it to personal detritus layer; it remains searchable.  
4. **Check-in**: Brief reflection — is there any learning left to record?  

### Community-Level
1. **Detect**: AI hygiene scan or Guardian notes fragment inactivity.  
2. **Announce**: Circle informed: “This item is scheduled to fade.”  
3. **Window**: 7–14 days for any member to **re-endorse** its value.  
4. **Fade**: If no re-endorsement → fragment composted.  
5. **Log**: Record fade in circle ledger (date, fragment, reason).  

---

## Decision Rules
- **Gentle first**: Always attempt fade before stab.  
- **Fades are reversible**: Any fragment can be re-endorsed back to active use.  
- **Silence = consent**: If nobody speaks for it, it fades.  
- **Keep compost alive**: Faded items remain retrievable, but not active stock.  

---

## Outputs
- **Individual-level**: fragment marked as faded, journal note if desired.  
- **Community-level**: compost entry, ledger log, optional reflection round.  

---

## Artifacts
- `status: faded` metadata in cards/prompts.  
- Community compost pool (`compost.yaml`).  
- Fade logs: `logs/fades/YYYYMMDD_fragment.md`.  

---

## Failure Modes & Counters
- **Neglect drift**: Too many fades leave practitioners without anchor → Guardian ensures essentials never fade without conscious re-endorsement.  
- **Sentimental hoarding**: Refusal to fade anything → introduce decay metrics (auto-fade if untouched 180 days).  
- **Ghost clutter**: Compost becomes noisy → AI hygiene tools enforce schema + deduplication.  
- **False fade**: Something fades while still quietly alive → members can immediately re-endorse, restoring status.  

---

## Notes
- Fade ≠ deletion. It is **gentle impermanence**.  
- Works in concert with Stab Protocol: fade first, stab if dignity/core principles are at stake.  
- Inspired by natural cycles: leaves fall, compost feeds soil, new growth emerges.
