## Purpose

To identify and respond to *distortions in responsibility* that undermine trust, collaboration, and system resilience. These patterns often hide in habitual roles or team dynamics and are invisible until failure or conflict erupts.

---

## Core Patterns

### 1. Blame Sink
**Definition:**  
One person becomes the default container for failures, regardless of true causality.

**Diagnostic Cues:**
- *Relational:* Others visibly relax when you enter blame-receiving mode; immediate finger-pointing without investigation
- *Self-talk:* "Here we go again" / "I guess it's my fault somehow" / automatic apologizing
- *System signs:* Same person repeatedly in hot seat; others stop self-checking; post-mortems become person-focused

**Shadow Costs:**
- *Self:* Chronic stress, learned helplessness, imposter syndrome
- *Others:* Reduced accountability, atrophied problem-solving skills
- *System:* Real issues stay hidden; scapegoating becomes cultural norm

**Practice Hooks:**
- Before accepting blame, pause and ask: "What would investigating this look like?"
- Daily check: "What did I apologize for today that wasn't actually mine?"
- Redirect: "Let's map what happened step-by-step" instead of "I'm sorry"

**Countermoves:**  
- **Name the distortion:** "I think I'm acting as a blame sink right now; let's re-check who owned what."  
- Shift conversation to *system troubleshooting* not *person-targeting*.  
- Distribute ownership: shared logs, co-created systems.

### 2. Credit Hog
**Definition:**  
One actor captures disproportionate praise for collective success.

**Diagnostic Cues:**
- *Relational:* Team members stop volunteering ideas; contributions become invisible in your presence
- *Self-talk:* "I basically did this whole thing" / minimizing others' input in internal narrative
- *System signs:* Recognition flows upward only; team members seek credit elsewhere

**Shadow Costs:**
- *Self:* Inflated ego becomes fragile; teammates withdraw expertise
- *Others:* Demoralization, reduced investment, brain drain
- *System:* Knowledge hoarding; innovation drops as people disengage

**Practice Hooks:**
- End meetings with: "Who else made this possible?"
- Weekly reflection: "Whose contributions did I highlight this week?"
- Redirect praise: "That success had several architectsâ€”let me name them"

**Countermoves:**  
- Build explicit crediting practices ("who helped this succeed?").  
- Rotate visible leadership roles.
- Institute "contribution mapping" for all major wins.

---

### 3. Diffuse Responsibility *(a.k.a. Bystander Effect)*
**Definition:**  
No one owns the outcome because "someone else will handle it."

**Diagnostic Cues:**
- *Relational:* Everyone assumes others are handling critical tasks; vague "we should" language
- *Self-talk:* "Someone more qualified will step up" / "That's not really my area"
- *System signs:* Tasks fall between cracks; no clear ownership chains; crisis management becomes norm

**Shadow Costs:**
- *Self:* Guilt when things fail; reduced sense of agency
- *Others:* Frustration with "irresponsible" teammates; overwork for high-ownership people
- *System:* Critical functions neglected; reactive rather than proactive culture

**Practice Hooks:**
- When saying "we should," immediately ask "who specifically?"
- Weekly scan: "What am I assuming someone else owns?"
- Use explicit ownership language: "I own X, you own Y, we co-own Z"

**Countermoves:**  
- Assign explicit owner for each task.  
- Make ownership visible (dashboards, logs).
- Institute "ownership nomination" for ambiguous responsibilities.

---

### 4. Over-Ownership
**Definition:**  
One person takes responsibility for everything, even outside their remit.

**Diagnostic Cues:**
- *Relational:* Others become passive; "just ask [name], they'll handle it" becomes common
- *Self-talk:* "If I don't do it, it won't get done right" / "I can't trust others with this"
- *System signs:* Single points of failure; knowledge silos; others' skills atrophy

**Shadow Costs:**
- *Self:* Burnout, resentment, bottleneck stress
- *Others:* Learned helplessness, reduced growth opportunities
- *System:* Fragility; innovation stagnation; succession crisis

**Practice Hooks:**
- Before taking on tasks, ask: "Who else could own this?"
- Daily boundary check: "What did I do today that someone else should have?"
- Practice delegating with: "I trust you to handle this completely"

**Countermoves:**  
- Clarify scope; redistribute tasks.  
- Build trust others can handle responsibilities.
- Create explicit "development handoffs" to grow others' capabilities.

---

### 5. Responsibility Hot Potato
**Definition:**  
Everyone tries to offload a task/problem as quickly as possible.

**Diagnostic Cues:**
- *Relational:* Rapid handoffs without proper context; "that's not my department" reflexes
- *Self-talk:* "How can I get this off my plate?" / "Whose job is this really?"
- *System signs:* Tasks bouncing between people; information loss at handoffs; escalating urgency

**Shadow Costs:**
- *Self:* Reputation for avoiding hard problems; reduced trust
- *Others:* Frustration with "unreliable" teammates; information overload
- *System:* Work degrades through handoffs; fire-fighting culture; customer impact

**Practice Hooks:**
- Before passing tasks, ask: "What context does the next person need?"
- Weekly review: "What did I try to hand off that I should have owned?"
- Implement "clean handoff" protocols with explicit knowledge transfer

**Countermoves:**  
- Pause: name the pattern when observed.  
- Stabilize handoffs with clear agreements.
- Create "handoff quality" standards and accountability.

### 6. Mutual Deflection Loop
**Definition:**  
Each side argues the other is responsible, nothing moves.

**Diagnostic Cues:**
- *Relational:* Circular arguments; "but you said" / "but you did" exchanges; energy drain
- *Self-talk:* "They need to take responsibility first" / "I'm not budging until they admit..."
- *System signs:* Stalled projects; recurring meetings with no progress; stakeholder frustration

**Shadow Costs:**
- *Self:* Chronic stress; reputation for being "difficult"
- *Others:* Exhaustion; avoidance of future collaboration
- *System:* Paralysis; resource waste; team fragmentation

**Practice Hooks:**
- Notice "but you" arising and pause before speaking
- Ask: "What if we're both right about the other's responsibility?"
- Redirect to: "What would co-investigation look like?"

**Countermoves:**  
- Move to neutral ground: "Can we co-investigate root cause?"  
- Define next action together.
- Use "both/and" framing instead of "either/or" blame.

---

### 7. Phantom Ownership
**Definition:**  
Someone claims responsibility for outcomes they cannot actually influence or control.

**Diagnostic Cues:**
- *Relational:* Taking blame/credit for others' independent choices; "I should have prevented that"
- *Self-talk:* "I'm responsible for everyone's success/happiness" / "If I'd been better, they wouldn't have..."
- *System signs:* Unrealistic accountability chains; people avoiding decision-making; co-dependency patterns

**Shadow Costs:**
- *Self:* Anxiety about uncontrollable outcomes; god-complex followed by crashes
- *Others:* Reduced agency; infantilization; resentment at being "managed"
- *System:* Unclear actual accountability; decisions bottleneck through phantom owner

**Practice Hooks:**
- Daily reality check: "What outcomes did I influence vs. control today?"
- When feeling responsible, ask: "What was actually my choice vs. theirs?"
- Practice saying: "That was their choice, and I support their right to make it"

**Countermoves:**
- Map actual vs. imagined influence zones
- Distinguish support from control
- Practice "responsible to" vs. "responsible for" language

## Micro-Protocols

### Blame-Loop Defusion
1. **Somatic Grounding:** 3 breaths; feel feet on ground
2. **Pattern Naming:** "I think we're in a blame loop"  
3. **Shift Frame:** "Can we troubleshoot the system together?"
4. **Co-Define Fix:** Assign next steps + ownership explicitly
5. **Seal Agreement:** "So we both own [specific next actions]?"

### Responsibility Reset
1. **Pause Processing:** "Let's pause and map actual ownership here"
2. **Inventory Reality:** List what happened vs. who decided what
3. **Name Distortions:** Identify which patterns are active
4. **Redistribute Cleanly:** Assign appropriate ownership going forward
5. **Install Safeguards:** Set check-ins to prevent pattern recurrence

---

## Practice Hooks

### Daily Micro-Practices
- **Morning scan:** "What am I over/under-owning today?"
- **Evening review:** "Where did I notice responsibility distortions?"
- **Transition moments:** Before accepting/deflecting responsibility, pause and breathe

### Weekly Reflections
- Map your default pattern under stress (blame sink, credit hog, etc.)
- Notice which relationships trigger which distortions
- Practice counter-pattern language with low-stakes situations

### Monthly Systems Check
- Audit team/family responsibility distributions
- Identify chronic hot potatoes or phantom ownerships
- Design experiments to rebalance ownership patterns

---

## Integration Points

### With PCE Framework
- **Competence:** Distinguish actual capability boundaries from phantom ownership
- **Care:** Notice when responsibility distortions harm relationship quality  
- **Clarity:** Use clean ownership agreements to prevent ethical drift
- **Consent:** Ensure responsibility assignments are mutually agreed, not imposed

### With Conflict Resolution Guide v1.7
- **Stage 2 (Issue Mapping):** Use responsibility patterns as diagnostic lens
- **Stage 4 (Solution Design):** Address underlying ownership distortions, not just surface conflicts
- **Post-Resolution:** Install ownership clarity to prevent pattern recurrence

### With Core PoTM Practices
- **Waiting With:** Notice urge to over-own others' emotional processes
- **Signal Bleed:** Distinguish your responsibility signals from absorbed others'
- **Somatic Tracking:** Body cues often reveal responsibility distortions before mental awareness
