# 💞 Relationship Checklist 

**What this is:**  
This is a simple tool to help you figure out whether a relationship feels healthy, respectful, and good for you. It could be about a friend, family member, coworker, or even someone you just met.

**Why it matters:**  
Sometimes we get used to relationships that leave us feeling small, tired, or confused. This checklist helps you pay attention to how things *really* feel—not just what you *wish* they were.

## ✅ Seven Simple Questions

Ask yourself these. You don’t have to get all “yes” answers—but if a lot of them are “no,” it might be worth thinking about.

---

### 1. Do you both pay attention to each other?
**Good sign:** You both listen, ask questions, and care about what’s going on.  
**Warning sign:** You’re always the one reaching out, and they barely respond.

---

### 2. Can you say “no” without getting in trouble?
**Good sign:** You can set a boundary or ask for space without drama.  
**Warning sign:** You feel scared or guilty saying “no,” or they get mad if you do.

---

### 3. Can you talk about real stuff without it blowing up?
**Good sign:** You can share hard feelings and work through them.  
**Warning sign:** Every hard conversation turns into a fight or silence.

---

### 4. Do they respect your point of view, even when it’s different?
**Good sign:** You don’t have to agree on everything, and that’s okay.  
**Warning sign:** They always have to be right, and your opinions get brushed off.

---

### 5. When things go wrong, do they try to make it right?
**Good sign:** They admit mistakes and care about how you feel.  
**Warning sign:** They pretend nothing happened, or blame you instead.

---

### 6. Are they mostly honest and kind with you?
**Good sign:** You can trust what they say, and they treat you with care.  
**Warning sign:** There’s lying, guilt-tripping, or saying one thing and doing another.

---

### 7. Does this relationship help you grow or feel more like yourself?
**Good sign:** You feel supported, seen, and stronger over time.  
**Warning sign:** You feel smaller, stuck, or like you’re always pretending.

## 🌱 Extra Things to Think About

- Do you feel better or worse after spending time with them?
- Can you be yourself, or do you feel like you’re acting?
- What would happen if you were totally honest with them?
- Is it safe to be quiet together, or do you feel pressure to perform?

---

## 🧭 How to Use This

- **Use it like a mirror.** Not to judge—but to *see* clearly.
- **Use it when something feels off.** It’s a way to check in with yourself.
- **Use it to start a conversation.** You can even share it with someone you care about.

**Final thought:**  
No relationship is perfect. But you deserve ones where your voice matters, your space is respected, and you feel like *you*—not just someone trying to keep the peace.
