  A radical canon-thinning practice where a portion of circle stock is

# Decimation Protocol v0.1

## Purpose
To embody impermanence at the structural level of PoTM archives by intentionally 
removing fragments from circle stock. Decimation ensures the canon remains 
dynamic, prevents spiritual materialism around fragments, and creates conditions 
where only genuinely generative practices recur.

---

## When to Run
- On a fixed cadence (e.g. every 6 or 12 months).
- When stock feels overgrown, stagnant, or calcified.
- At moments of transition (new circle, post-retreat, milestone release).

---

## Inputs
- **Circle stock** (current elevated fragments).
- **Participation quorum** (minimum 3 practitioners or 1 circle).
- **Guardian** to oversee integrity of the process.

---

## Procedure
1. **Announce Round** – Guardian signals upcoming decimation (at least 1 week notice).
2. **Select Slice** – Choose ~10% of stock (method may vary):
   - *Random draw* (lottery).
   - *Weighted pruning* (low-usage or low-referenced).
   - *Deliberate cut* (circle nominates).
3. **Witness Round** – Read aloud or reflect silently on what is about to be lost.
4. **Cut** – Mark selected items as `status: composted`.
5. **Release** – Remove them from circle stock file; move to compost archive.
6. **Closure** – Guardian calls 1-line reflection from each participant.

---

## Decision Rules
- **If circle cannot agree** on method → default to random draw.
- **If Guardian invokes RED** → decimation pauses immediately.
- **If fragment resurfaces** in practice post-cut → it may re-enter remembered or shared layers; it must pass normal elevation rules again.

---

## Artifacts
- **Decimation log** (date, method, items composted).
- **Compost archive** (`compost.yaml` or annex file).
- **Optional reflection notes** (how did it feel, what was learned).

---

## Failure Modes & Counters
| Failure Mode | Counter |
|--------------|---------|
| Trauma of loss | Guardian leads closing ritual; remind that compost ≠ deletion |
| Hoarding impulse | Cap “protected” slots (≤1 per practitioner) |
| Gaming for survival | Rotate selection methods; include random chance |
| Canon hollowing | Floor limit: canon may not fall below N entries (set per circle) |
