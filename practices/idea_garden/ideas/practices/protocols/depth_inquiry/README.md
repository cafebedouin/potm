# Depth Inquiry: Forked Branches Overview

This README explains the rationale, structure, and navigation between two active development branches of **Depth Inquiry**, a core framework within *Pilates of the Mind*.

---

## 🪚 Why Fork the Principle?

Field reviews (2025-07-25 to 2025-07-27) revealed a tension between:

- **Clarity & Simplicity** — necessary for early-stage practitioners and real-world field testing
- **Depth & Pedagogical Scaffolding** — necessary for trainers, facilitators, and advanced users

Rather than compromise, we adopted a **dual-branch strategy** that allows each version to serve its purpose without dilution.

## 🌱 Branches in Use

| Branch         | Use Case                         | Location                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `v1.4.1`       | 💡 *Field-Testing / Quick Start* | `core/principle/depth_principle_v1.4.1.md`  |
| `v1.5-dev`     | 🧠 *Trainer / Pedagogical Build* | `core/principle/depth_principle_v1.5-dev.md`|

---

### 🔹 `v1.4.1` – Field-Test Edition

**Features:**
- Compact, single-file document
- Quick Start section
- Minimal conceptual overhead
- Clear entry point and integration cues
- Embedded stopping criteria

**Best for:**
- New practitioners
- Real-world testing environments
- Simple facilitation with minimal prep

---

### 🔸 `v1.5-dev` – Trainer/Facilitator Edition

**Features:**
- Modular structure with optional extensions
- Full pedagogical scaffolding
- Expanded examples and lineage
- Trainer-level guidance
- Modular deep dives: attunement, discomfort, reframing, cognitive shifts

**Best for:**
- Facilitator training
- Skill assessment
- Pattern coaching
- Complex group dynamics

## 🧭 Navigation Guidelines

| Goal                               | Recommended Path                                |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Learn the principle                | Read `v1.4.1` Quick Start                        |
| Explore deeper applications        | Read `v1.5-dev` core + relevant modules          |
| Facilitate training                | Use `v1.5-dev` as reference scaffold             |
| Give feedback or field test        | Begin with `v1.4.1`, then compare with `v1.5-dev`|

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loop

Field testing of `v1.4.1` will inform:

- Refinements to stopping conditions
- Language tuning for accessibility
- Practitioner needs that may be backported into `v1.5-dev`

Trainers using `v1.5-dev` are invited to co-develop:

- Additional optional modules
- Visual scaffolds or practitioner pathways
- Assessments and group facilitation tools

---

## 🔗 Related Components

This principle is conceptually adjacent to:

- `epistemic_integrity_checklist`
- `recursive_reframing`
- `disorientation_drills`
- `membrane_model`
- `dialogic_edge_work`

Each expands on or complements the internal logic of Depth work.

## ✅ Status

This meta-README is considered **stable** and governs the use of both branches.

For edits to either version, update this README accordingly to reflect status, changes, or cross-compatibility.
