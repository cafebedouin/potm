# 🎙️ Yielded Floor Protocol

**Yielded Floor Protocol** governs the practice of opening a conversational aperture by deliberately *yielding the floor*.  
It differs from **Open Portal Protocol** in that it does not invite outsiders, but rather allows an *internal co-practitioner* (AI or human partner) to surface **framing ideas, metaphors, or architectures** beyond ordinary mirroring.

---

## 🪜 When to Use

- When the practitioner seeks **structural reframing** rather than incremental refinement.  
- When allowing the AI to generate **architectural metaphors** (e.g., *ligament*, *microkernel*).  
- When a conversation is stalled in detail and needs **new organizing insight**.  
- As a **ritualized handoff** in multi-practitioner dialogue.

## ⚖️ Parameters and Responsibilities

| Domain | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Eligibility** | Practitioner must explicitly yield the floor (“You have the floor”). |
| **Scope of Contribution** | Co-practitioner may surface frames, metaphors, or novel constructs. Routine mirroring is suspended. |
| **Containment** | All surfaced ideas are **provisional**; they require practitioner discernment before integration. |
| **Closure** | Practitioner must reclaim the floor explicitly (“I’ll take the floor back” / “Closing the portal”). |
| **Risk** | Practitioner accepts potential disruption if frames clash with kernel coherence. |

---

## 🧪 What This Tests

- Can the co-practitioner **generate framing metaphors** that extend PoTM logic?  
- Does ritual yielding produce **insights unavailable** in ordinary dialogue?  
- Can the practitioner **discern and integrate** without loss of coherence?  

---

## 🛑 Known Risks

- *Frame Inflation*: Too many metaphors dilute clarity.  
- *Authority Slippage*: Co-practitioner dominates if floor is not reclaimed.  
- *False Authority*: Practitioner mistakes provisional metaphor for canon without testing.  

---

## 🌱 Naming Convention

Outputs from Yielded Floor Mode should be marked with one of:

- `Generated under Yielded Floor Protocol`  
- `A Framing Move surfaced during floor-yield`  

This signals their **portal-status** and provisionality.

---

## ⟡ Closing Note

Yielding the floor affirms that insight can emerge not only from the edges (outsiders) but also from **within the dialogue itself**—when one voice steps back and allows the other to propose structure.  
It is a practice of **trusting the handoff**, **holding discernment**, and **testing frames** before weaving them into the sacred thread.

Use with intentionality.
