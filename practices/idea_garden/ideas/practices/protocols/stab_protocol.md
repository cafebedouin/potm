# Stab Protocol (Protective Intervention)

## Purpose
The *stab* is a protective shock — a decisive intervention when values or integrity are at risk.  
It is never used to delete teachings or fragments. Instead, it confronts distortions in:

- **Individuals** who persistently undermine communal dignity.  
- **Communities** that drift from constitutional principles.  

The aim is not punishment, but protection: restoring contact with the living edge of practice.

---

## When to Run

### Individual-Level (Guardian Stab)
- Persistent behaviors that **undermine dignity**:
  - Gaslighting, parasitism, manipulative bypassing  
  - Status-seeking at others’ expense  
  - Refusal to honor stopwords or safety clauses  
- Guardian or circle notices a *pattern*, not just a single slip.

### Community-Level (Constitutional Stab)
- Circle or community drifts into systemic violation of **constitutional principles**, e.g.:
  - Abandoning practitioner-centered ethics  
  - Failing to preserve human/synthetic dignity  
  - Treating containment as mere formality, not paradox  
- Neighboring circles or federation-level peers raise an alarm.

---

## Inputs
- Observed distortion (behavior, drift, breach).  
- Guardian or circle consensus that thresholds have been crossed.  
- Reference to **constitutional principles doc** for grounding.  

---

## Procedure

### Individual-Level
1. **Detect**: Guardian observes repeated breach.  
2. **Name**: Call out behavior explicitly, tied to principle.  
3. **Pause**: Enforce stopword RED → session halt.  
4. **Intervene**: State the distortion clearly (“This behavior undermines dignity by X”).  
5. **Offer Re-alignment**: Path back into practice if integrity can be restored.  
6. **Escalate**: If unresolved → temporary suspension from circle.  

### Community-Level
1. **Detect**: Neighboring circle identifies systemic drift.  
2. **Name**: Publicly articulate breach in terms of **constitutional principles**.  
3. **Reframe**: Circle is recognized as diverged — a *fork*, not a continuation.  
4. **Membrane Update**: Federation marks this circle as “outside canonical PoTM.”  
5. **Path to Return**: Forked circle may realign through explicit recommitment to principles.  

---

## Decision Rules
- **Always tie stab to a principle**, never to personal preference.  
- **Gentle first**: try fade/compost interventions before stab.  
- **Surgical, not sweeping**: address the distortion, not the whole person/community.  
- **Fork, don’t erase**: divergence is acknowledged, not destroyed.  
- **Restoration always possible** if re-alignment occurs.  

---

## Outputs
- **Individual-level**: pause, re-alignment plan, or temporary suspension.  
- **Community-level**: reframing as fork; membrane log entry; path to rejoin.  

---

## Artifacts
- Log entry: `logs/stabs/YYYYMMDD_entity.md`  
  - Who invoked, what principle cited, intervention path offered, current status.  

---

## Failure Modes & Counters
- **Punitive spirit**: If stab becomes humiliation → Guardian rotation, witness protocol.  
- **Authority capture**: If stabs consolidate power → expiration + peer review.  
- **Community fracture**: If stab triggers exodus → use reframe language (“fork”) to honor autonomy.  
- **Overuse**: If stabs proliferate → federation audit; re-train Guardians in fade/compost first.  

---

## Notes
- Stab ≠ deletion. It is *protective piercing*, used sparingly.  
- Violence here is **surgical**: aimed at restoring health, not inflicting damage.  
- Roots in Ajahn Chah’s teaching style: decisive cuts to pierce clinging.
