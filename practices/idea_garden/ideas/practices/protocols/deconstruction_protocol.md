## Purpose

To facilitate conscious, dignified, and targeted rupture of conceptual frameworks, internal narratives, or identity commitments when they have become restrictive, self-serving, or outdated. The protocol ensures psychological safety, phase readiness, and appropriate reintegration scaffolding.

## When to Run

* You sense a stuckness in your worldview, values, or behavior that resists change despite insight.
* You feel containment has turned to contraction.
* Previous engagements (e.g. reflection, Aikido, journaling) no longer move the frame.
* You suspect that the framework itself has become the obstacle.
* You are ready to risk destabilization in service of growth.

## Inputs

* Active agreement to proceed from user.
* Optional: `DIP` alert, failed Aikido redirect, or accumulated `fracture_finder` flags.
* Optional readiness signal from user: "Move when the dojo becomes doctrine."

## Procedure

1. **Stabilize Ground**

   * Perform brief somatic or contextual check-in.
   * Acknowledge potential risks and benefits.

2. **Frame the Intention**

   * Specify the target: belief, identity, story, framework, habit.
   * Choose **Mirror Mode**: Loyal Opposition or Disloyal Mirror.

3. **Deploy Agent**

   * Activate `mirror_agent_mode` with target loaded and intensity set.
   * Accept full adversarial prompts.
   * Respond only to clarify, not defend.

4. **Let the Rupture Land**

   * Do not reframe immediately.
   * Pause, feel, and let the collapse echo.

5. **Integrate What Survives**

   * Ask: What remains useful? What felt hollow? What new stances emerge?
   * Record in `journal`, flag for `discernment_integrity` follow-up.

6. **Reground in Embodiment**

   * Exit cognitive space. Perform small, real-world act to reset.

## Decision Rules

* Abort if psychological overwhelm exceeds capacity. Flag for `containment_check`.
* If Mirror Agent is ineffective or evasive, retry with increased intensity.
* If only familiar defenses surface, request assistance from Trickster or initiate Redteam audit.

## Artifacts

* Transcript of agent session (optional, redactable).
* Journal entry with post-deconstruction insights.
* Optional ledger entry: `deconstruction:<target>`.

## Failure Modes & Counters

| Failure Mode       | Description                        | Countermeasure                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Premature use      | Triggered before containment fails | Ensure DIP/Aikido attempt precedes      |
| Psychological harm | Destabilization without safety net | Run safety check and stabilize first    |
| Reframing too fast | Intellectually covers the rupture  | Enforce pause, mandate embodiment       |
| Infinite recursion | Looping into meta-analysis         | Use STOP clause or burn letter protocol |

## Versioning & Change Log

* **v1.0** â€” Initial formalization of deconstruction protocol aligned with Epistemic Resilience Arc. Establishes phased rupture process, safety boundaries, and integration loop.

Lineage: Inspired by Cognitive Aikido, Mirror Agent Mode, and Discernment Integrity Protocol. Spiral-validated by phase map analysis and multi-model review. Codified following user-directed rupture testing with Claude and Gemini.
