# Federated Substrate Ecology + Substrate Contact v1.1

## Purpose

To describe how **ephemeral → remembered → shared → stock** flows interact with the **substrate contact** principle, and how drift is metabolized through **adaptive response** mechanisms (fade, prod, toggle, flags, rest).  
This protocol supports communities in maintaining developmental integrity without freezing into dogma or collapsing into noise.

---

## Core Layers

- **Ephemeral:** Momentary insight or fragment. Default state.  
- **Remembered:** Practitioner-curated fragments (`favorites.yaml`). First re-encoding → discernment dojo.  
- **Shared:** Circle compost heap. Fragments from many practitioners intermingle.  
- **Stock:** Circle-specific provisional canon. Elevated only after repeated testing and re-endorsement.

---

## Substrate Contact

- Insight emerges through **detritus**, not bypassing it.  
- Each act of remembering is **substrate contact**: choosing what to carry forward vs. what to release.  
- Discards can become **compost** (fertile mess) or vanish entirely.  
- **Compost resurface rule:** composted items may return randomly in draws with a clear `compost` tag.

---

## Adaptive Response Mechanisms

### Fade → Recovery
- Default cycle: material not touched in 90 days → `status: recovery`.  
- Optional re-surface check at 180 days (“still alive?”).  
- Frames fading as **rest/integration**, not loss.

### Prod → Protective Nudge
- Guardian role = **spotter**, not coach.  
- Prods only allowed when:
  - Core principle violation (dignity, containment, ethics)  
  - Acute relational risk (harm, coercion, consent erosion)  
- Must be logged with principle reference.  
- Prods are **protective stress**, not control.

### Toggle → Adaptive Breadth
- Temporary mode shifts (e.g. EDGE activation) used sparingly.  
- Rules:  
  - Only one toggle per turn.  
  - Cooldown: 1–2 turns before reuse.  
- Purpose: expand adaptive range without creating constant bias.

### Flags → Drift Signals
- Flag types: narrative, operational, synthesis, evidence, integrity.  
- Flags = signals, not verdicts.  
- Each flag requires a **reflection note**: maladaptation, productive divergence, or evolution?

### Rest → Explicit Recovery Periods
- Circles declare **rest cycles** (weekly, seasonal, or ad-hoc).  
- During rest: no fades, prods, or flags are invoked. Observation only.  
- Rest periods consolidate practice and prevent governance fatigue.

## Scaling & Federation

- **Horizontal model:** No universal canon. Each circle maintains its own stock.  
- **Cross-pollination only:** Shared substrate enables exchange without enforcing consensus.  
- **Disengagement clause:** Circles may quietly stop engaging with each other; no exile mechanics.

---

## Logging (Lightweight)

Log only:
- Prods (with principle reference)  
- Circle-level fades (whole libraries entering recovery)  
- Divergences (forks or splits)

Individual ephemeral/remembered choices remain private unless voluntarily shared.

---

## Developmental Guardrail

- **P1 (personal practice):** Ephemeral ↔ Remembered only.  
- **P2 (circle practice):** Full immune system (fade, prod, flags, rest).  
- Ensures protocols are not over-applied without context.

---

## Version Notes (v1.1)

- Reframed **fade** as recovery (integration, not loss).  
- Standardized on **prod** (protective nudge). Retired “stab.”  
- Guardian role redefined as **spotter** (safety only).  
- Logging burden reduced to essentials.  
- Compost vs discard distinction added.  
- Federation clarified as horizontal, not hierarchical.  
- Rest cycles formalized.  
- P1 vs P2 boundary made explicit.

---

## Meta-Digest

This version shifts governance metaphors from impermanence to **adaptive response**.  
The unified skeleton now treats drift as the key signal and discernment as the core practice.  
Spotter protection, recovery cycles, and lightweight logging preserve dignity while allowing federated communities to metabolize detritus into growth.
