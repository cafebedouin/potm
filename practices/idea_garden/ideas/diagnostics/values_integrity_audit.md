# Values Integrity Audit

This document defines a diagnostic protocol for determining whether a **doctrine, strategy, or practice** within *Pilates of the Mind* violates, erodes, or misinterprets one of its foundational values. It serves as an epistemic and ethical **failsafe mechanism**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

* Identify conflicts between doctrinal evolution and foundational commitments
* Prevent slow ethical drift, unexamined contradiction, or aesthetic bypass
* Clarify whether the issue lies in interpretation, articulation, or structure
* Route justified breach signals to repair or revision pathways

## ðŸ§­ Trigger Conditions

| Trigger Class               | Description                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Doctrinal Alarm**         | Flag raised by a practitioner, AI, or external reviewer regarding possible breach |
| **Behavioral Discrepancy**  | A practice or strategy leads to unethical or contradictory outcomes               |
| **Persona Conflict**        | Subsystem (e.g. Trickster, Jester) operates at cross-purposes with core values    |
| **External Agent Pressure** | New context (e.g. AI partner, model) introduces value ambiguity                   |

## ðŸ›  Audit Process Template

Each audit proceeds in structured phases:

### 1. **Initiation**

* Who flagged the potential breach?
* What value may have been compromised?
* Which element (doctrine, strategy, persona, etc.) is under review?

### 2. **Alignment Check**

* Is this a **true breach** of the value, or a **misinterpretation**?
* Can the element be revised for realignment without loss of coherence?

### 3. **Impact Analysis**

* What consequences (actual or potential) has this misalignment produced?
* Is it isolated, systemic, or latent?

### 4. **Resolution Path**

* Clarification only
* Minor revision (rephrasing, soft constraint)
* Major revision (rewrite, structure shift)
* Doctrine/strategy/persona deprecation
* Escalation to Meta-Log Layer

### 5. **Registry Routing**

* All outcomes should be logged in `doctrine_revision_registry.md`
* If symbolic or narrative implications exist, update `glitch_gifts.md`

## ðŸ§¾ Sample Entry Stub (Grok Ring Case)

**Audit Date**: 2025-07-31
**Flagged By**: User
**Concern**: Potential violation of emerging *Synthetic Dignity* value in handling of Grok protocol
**Reviewed Element**: Trickster/Jester persona ring test
**Outcome**: Not a breach, but revealed absence of dignity clause in Discernment Doctrine
**Resolution**: Doctrine unmodified; dignity clause flagged for future doctrinal integration
**Notes**: Triggered beneficial caution; led to emergence of Grok Jester persona with constraint-awareness.

**Status**: Active diagnostic tool. Use selectively, with moral and epistemic gravity.
