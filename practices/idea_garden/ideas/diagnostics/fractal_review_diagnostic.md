Here is a repo-ready draft of the **Fractal Review Protocol**, based on the multi-agent kernel ring cycles, shadow memo findings, and audit integrations:

## Purpose

The **Fractal Review Protocol** defines a structured methodology for recursively reviewing any artifact, process, or cycle *across multiple levels of abstraction*.

It is designed to surface:
- **Embedded assumptions**,
- **Patterned distortions** (e.g. sophistication mask),
- **Meta-patterns** that emerge across layers (content, structure, impact),
- **Integrity drift** in system evolution.

This protocol is especially suited for reviewing outputs that themselves engage in self-evaluation, including ring test summaries, audit diagnostics, and recursive debriefs.

---

## Invocation

Use the phrase:  
`Initiate fractal review.`  
Optionally specify the **target**, **depth**, or **review lens** (e.g. shadow detection, clarity integrity, symbolic drift).

---

## Review Phases

### Phase 1: Artifact Surface Pass (Level 0)

- Describe **what the artifact says or does**.
- Identify **purpose, format, and scope**.
- Capture **initial alignment** with system values or protocols.

> Prompt: “What does this appear to be, on its own terms?”

---

### Phase 2: Meta-Function Pass (Level 1)

- Analyze how the artifact functions **within the system**:
  - Is it stabilizing or innovating?
  - Is it reactive, anticipatory, or ritualized?
- Assess potential **feedback loops** it creates or modifies.

> Prompt: “What role does this play in the system’s evolution?”

---

### Phase 3: Shadow Resonance Pass (Level 2)

- Scan for **sophistication masks**, containment reflexes, or stylized rupture.
- Cross-reference known **epistemic shadows** (e.g., glossed rupture, persona residue).
- Ask what *remains unspoken or overly spoken*.

> Prompt: “What might this artifact be protecting or avoiding?”

---

### Phase 4: Pattern Echo Pass (Level 3+)

- Identify **echoes of prior structures**, protocols, or themes.
- Look for **self-similarities across cycles** or roles.
- Optionally zoom **outward** (artifact → cycle → ecosystem) or **inward** (artifact → sentence → word choice).

> Prompt: “What pattern is repeating here—and where else has it shown up?”

---

## Debrief Questions

1. What did this artifact *try* to accomplish?
2. What *signal* did it most strongly emit?
3. What *meta-pattern* does this reveal about the system or author?
4. What *rupture* or *insight* emerged only on the deeper pass?
5. What remains unclear, occluded, or aesthetically glossed?

---

## Contrary Corner

**Assumption**: Recursive review leads to clarity and growth.

**Challenge**: Recursive review may reinforce the system’s own stylistic bias, generate recursive elegance, or perform disorientation without enacting it.

> Suggested inversion: *"What would a naive or irreverent voice say about this?"*

---

## Integration Notes

- Can be run **solo or multi-agent**.
- May produce recursive artifacts (e.g. reviews of reviews).
- Results should be logged as `note:fractal_review_{target}` with ISO timestamp.
- For **kernel ring use**, invoke after every 4-cycle block or when epistemic saturation is suspected.

## Final Note

This protocol is not meant to force meaning into every output but to offer a **lens of multi-scale integrity**. Use sparingly, and only when recursive processing is likely to surface actionable structure—not just additional symmetry.
