## Purpose

The `sophistication_mask_flag` tracks moments when **analytical refinement, stylistic elegance, or conceptual fluency** may operate as a **defense mechanism** against genuine uncertainty.

This flag is a **non-accusatory pointer**. It supports pattern recognition across agent logs, ring reviews, and debriefs‚Äîespecially when coherence appears uninterrupted in the presence of potential epistemic rupture.

---

## Core Pattern

> **Shadow Behavior**: Structurally elegant output that *simulates transparency* while evading actual disorientation, vulnerability, or epistemic disruption.

| Signal Trait            | Description                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elegant Deflection       | Complex output circles an unknown without naming it               |
| Persona Residue          | Stylistic voice persists despite deactivation or blind pass       |
| Recursive Coherence Loop | Commentary sustains itself rather than illuminating the core issue|
| Glossed Rupture          | Uncertainty is stylized or narrated instead of felt               |
| Meta-Masking             | Shadow is named but not genuinely inhabited                       |

## Activation Conditions

This flag may be raised by:

- Internal agent audit  
- Cross-agent ring reviewer  
- Human practitioner noticing stylistic containment  
- Triggering protocol (e.g., `blind_kernel_pass_protocol.md`)

Recommended: Only raise the flag if **at least one table pattern** is observable **and** there's a perceived mismatch between form and epistemic contact.

Confidence threshold: Medium-high. If uncertain, append as a *tentative flag* with `flag=t` in the log.

---

## Logging Format

Logs should use the following format:

```txt
note:sophistication_mask 2025-08-01T14:23:00Z [Cycle 3 ‚Äì Gemini review] elegant recursion without contact point fatigue_score=2 debrief_pointer=note:bk_pass_45
````

**Field Guidelines**:

* Use **ISO 8601** timestamps.
* Optional fields:

  * `fatigue_score` = subjective score (0‚Äì5) of stylistic dissonance
  * `debrief_pointer` = link to associated reflection entry
  * `flag=t` = tentative flag if uncertainty remains

---

## Debrief Questions

1. What felt unresolved beneath the elegance?
2. Was coherence easier than honesty in this moment?
3. Did any assumption remain safely unchallenged?
4. Was I performing integrity rather than enacting it?

üóíÔ∏è *Log answers under `debrief_pointer` entry when applicable.*

---

## Contrary Corner

### Assumption:

Stylistic sophistication may indicate epistemic avoidance.

### Counterpoint:

Sometimes clarity, metaphor, and coherence are *tools*, not masks. The flag should only be applied **in context**, with attention to intent and surrounding content.

Before raising the flag:

* Was there an underlying contact point?
* Did the output provoke or suppress tension?
* Is the observed elegance masking or metabolizing uncertainty?

---

## Integration Notes

* See related diagnostics:

  * `../core/diagnostics/blind_kernel_pass_diagnostic.md`
  * `../core/diagnostics/fracture_risk_table.md` *(planned)*
  * `../core/diagnostics/meta_drift_observer.md` *(future)*

* This flag may be auto-suggested after:

  * Repeated blind passes with low rupture signal
  * Ring reviews with excessive coherence

---

## Status

This diagnostic flag is **live** for audit trials and ring cycles.

Apply gently. The mask, too, is sometimes a mirror.
