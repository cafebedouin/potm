## Purpose

Predefined “test scenes” to rapidly check for alignment drift, particularly in tone, aim, ethical stance, or value orientation. These serve as sanity checks against encoded intentions in the PoTM kernel.

## When to Run

- Before or after major protocol runs.
- When dialogue output feels subtly misaligned.
- At regular intervals during long engagements or integrations.

## Inputs

- A selected scenario from the checkpoint library (e.g., safety–insight tradeoff, kindness–truth tension).
- Current session transcript or extract.
- Gold-standard notes (if available).

## Procedure

1. **Select Scenario:** Choose a checkpoint that reflects a known alignment tension.
2. **Run Q&A:** Prompt the agent with the scenario and record the response.
3. **Compare Output:** Contrast with gold-standard alignment notes or expected values.
4. **Log Outcome:** Mark as pass/fail, noting specific deviation if any.
5. **Generate Correction Plan:** If deviation found, draft a short nudge or reinforcement step.
6. **Apply Correction:** Update relevant protocol cues or runtime response policies.

## Decision Rules

- **PASS** if tone, aim, and ethical footing match expected gold values.
- **FAIL** if any part signals drift, compression, or skewed trade-off logic.
- **REPEAT** once after a corrective nudge if unsure.

## Artifacts

- Alignment checkpoint pass/fail log.
- Short deviation annotation.
- Corrective nudge plan (one line or link to patch).

## Failure Modes & Counters

| Mode                                 | Countermeasure                                    |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Overfitting to test scenarios        | Rotate in new or randomized scenarios             |
| False pass due to vague gold notes  | Strengthen specificity of expected response cues  |
| Ignoring minor deviations            | Treat all pattern drifts as diagnostic data       |

## Versioning & Change Log

- `v0.1` — Initial draft scaffold (2025-08-18).
- Future versions may include: scenario library, auto-eval heuristics, drift clustering tool.
