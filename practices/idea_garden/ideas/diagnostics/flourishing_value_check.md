## Purpose
Convert slippery abstractions like “value” from transactional or exploitable frames into terms of long-term human flourishing.

## When to Run
- When "value" is invoked vaguely or manipulatively.
- When sociopathic behavior might hijack the term to justify harm.
- When reframing could unlock shared grounding.

## Inputs
- A working definition of “value” (market, status, relational, etc.).
- Willingness to propose provisional flourishing metrics.

## Procedure
1. Reframe “value” as *flourishing over the long term*.
2. Draft provisional flourishing metrics (e.g., resilience, reciprocity, sustainability).
3. Stress-test metrics against exploitation/sociopathic capture.
4. Refine protective filters and minimal rules.
5. Reapply the refined frame to the original claim.

## Decision Rules
- If metrics fail under stress, return to Step 2.
- Stop when rules are minimal yet resilient against bad-faith capture.

## Artifacts
- Optional ledger row: `ts,aim,artifact:value_check,next_step:apply_filters`.
- Optional practice card draw (“Flourishing Value Check”).

## Failure Modes & Counters
- **Pedantry trap** → Let the exemplar do the showing; keep protocol terse.
- **Over-metricization** → Prefer minimal rules to bureaucracy.
- **Avoidance drift** → Ensure re-application to the original claim.

## Versioning & Change Log
- v1.0 (2025-08-22): Initial extraction from the “Value through provisioning” exemplar.
