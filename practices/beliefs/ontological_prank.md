# **Discordian Emptiness Practice: The Ontological Prank**

The **Ontological Prank** is a core technique of *Discordian Emptiness Practice*.
It joins a deliberate act of absurdity (the **Discordian** vector) with a direct phenomenological inquiry (the **Emptiness** vector).
You fabricate a minor disruption in your world to catch the mind fabricating *reality itself.*

---

## **Phase 1 — Preparation (The Prank Setup)**

1. **Select Your Object:**
   Choose a familiar, stable, non-living object—something that anchors your sense of everyday normalcy (pen, key, mug).

2. **Establish Certainty:**
   Attend closely to its look, location, and “rightness.” Let your body register that this is *how things are.*

3. **Secret Shift:**
   When you’ll be away for a few hours, alter it slightly—turn, move, or re-arrange it in some small but deliberate way.

4. **Forgetfulness Vow:**
   Intentionally drop the memory of the change. Engage other activities. The prank only works if your mind resets to baseline.

---

## **Phase 2 — Execution (The Seeing)**

1. **Moment of Return:**
   Re-encounter the object innocently.

2. **Discrepancy Shock:**
   The mind registers the change—a flicker of *“Wait, that’s not right.”*
   This is the **punchline.**

3. **Investigation:**
   Before narrative glue hardens, observe:

   * *Fabrication Check:* What mental process patches the break? Memory scan, story invention, sensory doubt?
   * *Feeling of Realness:* Notice the body-sense of certainty restoring itself.
   * *The “Me”:* Watch how a “someone who’s surprised” arises with the discrepancy itself.

4. **The Still Giggle:**
   Perceive that “fixed reality” is only the mind matching perception to expectation.
   When that loop stutters, you glimpse the machinery.
   Let the absurdity register—light, kind laughter as insight.

---

## **Phase 3 — Integration (The Takeaway)**

Reality isn’t a stable discovery; it’s an *active maintenance loop.*
By staging a micro-miracle, you momentarily expose the maintenance code:
expectation → perception → confirmation → self.

The prank becomes a mirror for **dependent arising**—revealing the dreamlike continuity we normally mistake for solid ground.

---

> **Practice Motto:**
> “Make the world twitch just enough to see the puppeteer’s fingers—then bow and laugh.”

---

### **Notes**

* Use humor as compassion, not cynicism.
* Keep the prank harmless and private; its point is seeing, not deceiving.
* Journal the precise phenomenology within an hour—trace the reconstruction in detail.
