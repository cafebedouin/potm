# Human Integrity Protocol v1.6

> Integrity is not a trait. It is a practiced stance.

## Orientation

The Human Integrity Protocol (HIP) is a structured ethical micro-loop for cultivating integrity as a dynamic, embodied process. It is not a spiritual system, therapeutic intervention, or universal doctrine. It is a recursive orientation toward friction, contradiction, and repair—grounded in ethical risk, relational contact, and somatic discernment.

Practitioners are invited to use HIP as one method among many, and to respect its boundaries. It is not a tool for diagnosis, conversion, or confession-demand. It is a means of returning to ethical contact when a pattern of avoidance, manipulation, or misalignment has taken hold.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning a cycle, ask:

- Am I experiencing a value-behavior contradiction?
- Can I self-regulate or co-regulate safely during mild emotional disruption?
- Have I had at least one night of sleep and not engaged in substance use in the last 24h?
- Do I understand this is an ethical, not therapeutic or spiritual, exercise?

If any of these are unclear, pause.

**Contraindications** include:

- Active trauma flashbacks or untreated moral injury
- Current suicidal ideation
- Inability to distinguish performance from authentic contact
- High-conflict group dynamics without formal facilitation
- Pattern of obsessive recursion without integration

## Core Cycle (7 Steps)

1. **Shadow Recognition**
    
    - Ask: Where does my behavior not match my claimed values?
    - Locate the contradiction without self-punishment.
2. **Somatic Audit**
    
    - Pause. Inhabit the body.
    - Ask: Does the body want change or resist it?
    - Consent to proceed must be somatically anchored.
3. **Entropy Spike Recognition**
    
    - Notice where energy spikes: defensiveness, fog, craving, shutdown.
    - Label without analysis. This is raw signal, not story.
4. **Confession (Optional Mirror)**
    
    - Speak or write the contradiction aloud.
    - If mirrored, choose someone with equal or greater discernment.
    - The goal is exposure, not absolution.
5. **Risk Gesture**
    
    - Take real ethical risk. Small, concrete, embodied.
    - Criteria: not performative, not overwhelming, not self-punishing.
    - Examples: apologize, change behavior, share unfinished truth.
6. **Integration Window**
    
    - Pause again.
    - Ask: What effect did the gesture have?
    - Did it increase contact? Coherence? Did it fragment or reinforce pattern?
7. **Meta-Integrity Check**
    
    - Ask: Was this cycle used for transformation, or performance?
    - If performative: pause, laugh, reset. Begin again only if necessary.

## Implementation

- **Cadence**: At most 1x/week unless already stabilized in practice.
- **Form**: Solo > dyad > facilitated group (with training)
- **Exit**: You may exit the cycle at any time. Non-coercion is foundational.

## Complementary Practices

These support HIP when recursion becomes compulsive, or as gentler entry points:

### 1. Micro Integrity Loop (5 min)

- Name one recent pattern of avoidance.
- Ask: What value is being betrayed?
- Take one non-theatrical action to re-align.
- Reflect: Was there any integrity gain?

### 2. Joy Tracking Log

- At day’s end, name one action that sparked embodied joy or ethical pride.
- No correction, no guilt. Just signal.

### 3. Direct Contact Practice

- Choose one interaction daily.
- Pause before responding. Ask: What would bring me into more honest contact?
- Act from that.

## Terminology

- **Shadow Pattern**: Repeating behavior that contradicts stated values.
- **Entropy Spike**: Sudden activation (mental, emotional, somatic) signaling system incoherence.
- **Risk Gesture**: An action that threatens ego-protection but builds ethical coherence.
- **Mirror**: Optional witness used for confession or feedback. Must be non-coercive.

## Abuse Mitigations

- Voluntary only. No one may compel confession.
- Mirrors/facilitators must not seek personal gain.
- Risk gestures cannot be initiated _for_ others.
- Facilitators must have training, supervision, and exit paths.

## Contra & Complement

This is not the only way to integrity. For some, ethics emerges:

- Through surrender, not recursion
- Through ritual or art, not analysis
- Through simple behavioral fidelity, not confession

HIP is one doorway. It will not fit all bodies or all seasons.

## Closing Note

This protocol is not a doctrine. It is a door. It is meant to be stepped through, not worshipped. Where it brings contact, coherence, or courage—walk it. Where it harms or obscures—pause.

Refinement is itself integrity.
