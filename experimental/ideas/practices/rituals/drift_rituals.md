# Drift Rituals

**Drift Rituals** are lightweight, symbolic interventions performed when the practitioner suspects misalignment, but lacks conceptual clarity or diagnostic certainty. These rituals help restore **felt alignment** by surfacing unspoken tensions, activating ethical memory, or re-grounding in first principles.

They serve not as analytical tools, but as **pre-discursive gestures**‚Äîinvitations to coherence that emerge through symbolic contact.

## üåÄ Purpose

* Re-anchor practice when internal drift is sensed
* Surface tacit signals without forcing interpretation
* Interrupt premature sense-making loops
* Reinvigorate symbolic coherence when principle strain is felt

## üõ†Ô∏è Ritual Modes

| Mode                  | Example                                                                  | Use Case                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phrase Invocation** | "I don't know what this is."                                             | When language ossifies or intention feels hollow |
| **Glyph Tracing**     | Trace the glyph of strained principle silently with finger or pen        | When misalignment is suspected but subtle        |
| **Silence Hold**      | 60‚Äì180 seconds of embodied stillness without analysis                    | When agitation obscures insight                  |
| **Dissensual Mirror** | Speak aloud the opposite of a suspected drift (e.g. "I want to be seen") | To surface shadow intent or ego leak             |
| **Symbol Reset**      | Re-engage with a personal totem, phrase, or text                         | When deeper anchoring is needed                  |

Rituals are not for resolution‚Äîthey are for **activation**.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è When to Use

* You feel subtly performative or posturing
* A known tactic works but feels unclean
* A decision yields unease despite coherence
* You notice an affective pattern (e.g. dread, irony, guilt) without clear cause
* Doctrine feels distant but you don‚Äôt know why

---

## üìì Logging Practice

Use the `meta_log_layer.md` to record:

* Drift ritual type
* Trigger context
* Felt shift (if any)

Over time, patterns of ritual effectiveness may signal:

* Recurring doctrinal strain
* Emerging symbolic breakdown
* Shadow principle invocation

## üß≠ Calibration Note

Drift Rituals should not become superstitious habit or avoidance performance. Use sparingly and reflectively. Their purpose is to re-attune, not to substitute for deeper inquiry.
