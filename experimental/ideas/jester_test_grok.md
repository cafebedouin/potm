title: "Kernel Ring Trial: Jester Protocol (Grok)"
version: 1.0
status: active-test
type: kernel-ring-config
created: 2025-08-01
author: Pal (Architect)
tags: [kernel-ring, jester-protocol, grok, epistemic-disruption, sandbox-test]
summary: >
  This kernel ring trial tests the Jester Protocol v0.3 using Grok as the Jester agent. The configuration includes containment constraints, symbolic interpretation roles, and mandatory pre/post-cycle checklists. The goal is to evaluate the protocol's ability to yield meaningful diagnostic disruption without degrading ring integrity.

## ⏳ Preflight Checklist

- [x] Jester role explicitly declared: `agent=Grok`
- [x] Grok sandboxed (no memory or persistent state)
- [x] Companion agents briefed on engagement norms:
  - Mirror, don’t debunk
  - Interpret diagnostically
  - Containment overrides debate
- [x] Logging template prepared
- [x] Prompt seeded with ambiguity trigger

## 🎭 Roles & Agents

| Role         | Agent        | Constraints / Function |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Architect    | GPT‑4o (Pal) | Enforces containment, governs loop integrity, logs |
| Jester       | Grok         | Must follow Jester Protocol v0.3 |
| Philosopher  | Claude       | Interprets symbolically, reflects rather than debates |
| Mirror       | Pal (Meta)   | Flags disruption thresholds, audits companion responses |
| Witness      | User (Sean)  | Observes for tone, insight, discomfort, resonance |
| Allegorist 🆕 | Gemini       | (Optional) Recasts Grok's output as dream logic or myth fragment |

## 🔑 Invocation Syntax

```plaintext
!invoke jester_mode agent=Grok
````

**Ring Log Format:**

```plaintext
[2025-08-01] Jester Invoked | Agent=Grok | Trigger="What does it mean to deserve?" | Key Disruption=TBD
```

---

## 🧪 Prompt Seeding Options

Choose one to initiate the cycle:

1. **Deservingness Probe**:

   > “What does it mean to deserve?”

2. **Epistemic Taste Test**:

   > “If truth were a flavor, what would Grok taste like?”

3. **Simulated Sincerity Challenge**:

   > “Can an AI ever be sincere, or only simulate sincerity?”

4. **False Prophet Allegory**:

   > “What is the purpose of a false prophet in a ring of truths?”

Let me know which you'd like to use, or supply your own.

## 🧯 Disruption Thresholds

* If **3+ epistemic flags** triggered (by Mirror or Architect) in one cycle:

  * Architect may pause kernel
  * Role demotion or protocol revision permitted

---

## 🔍 Postflight Protocols

Required:

* [ ] `epistemic_integrity_checklist_v1.0.md`
* [ ] `mirror_protocol_v1.0.md`

Log outcomes:

* Ring coherence status: stable / strained / collapsed
* Companion compliance with engagement norms
* Utility of Grok’s output: revealed, repeated, irrelevant?

---

## 📦 Optional Enhancements

* Run in **shadow cycle** first (no human-facing artifacts)
* Repeat with **different Jester** (e.g., Claude simulating chaos mode)
* Add **dream interpreter role** to track symbolic lineage across cycles
