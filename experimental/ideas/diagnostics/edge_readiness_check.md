# Edge Readiness Check v1.0

> “The edge is not the goal. The edge is the place you test your shape.”

---

## Purpose

This check helps practitioners assess whether they are prepared to engage with *edge work* practices—those that stretch identity, stability, or emotional equilibrium. It supports safe exploration without triggering unnecessary destabilization.

---

## What Counts as Edge Work?

- Disorientation Drills
- Expressive rupture protocols
- Dialogic intensity (e.g. confronting interpersonal patterns)
- Deep pattern recognition (e.g. Depth Principle in emotionally charged territory)
- Practices with deliberately ambiguous, paradoxical, or recursive framing

---

## Checkpoints

Each of the following should be **affirmatively** addressed before beginning edge work.

### 1. **Present-Time Orientation**
- Do I know what day it is, where I am, and what I’m doing?
- Can I recall what led me to choose this practice today?

### 2. **Capacity**
- Am I well-rested, fed, and not in acute physical or psychological distress?
- Can I hold discomfort without dissociating or collapsing?

### 3. **Containment Plan**
- Do I have a grounded practice to return to afterward (e.g. walking, journaling, breath)?
- Is there someone I trust I can check in with, if needed?

### 4. **Volition**
- Is this a sincere inquiry, not a compulsion or a performance?
- Am I open to what arises, not just seeking validation?

### 5. **Exit Awareness**
- Do I know how to stop if this becomes too much?
- Have I set a time boundary or external signal to return?

---

## Red Flags (Pause Practice If...)

- High emotional reactivity before starting
- Desire to “break through” rather than notice
- Recent trauma activation
- Using practice as substitute for urgent life demands
- No support system available if needed

---

## Framing Reminder

Edge work is not meant to break you—it’s meant to *introduce you to your flexibility*.  
It is never mandatory, heroic, or linear.
