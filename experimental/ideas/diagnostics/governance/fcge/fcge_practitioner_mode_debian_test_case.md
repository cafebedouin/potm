# Practitioner Mode+ — Debian Project Governance

**Test Run Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Step-by-Step Diagnostic
1. **Channel:** Debian Project decision-making structure. Entry via Debian Developers (DD) process; exit via resignation/removal.  
2. **Mode Check:** Concurrent + Distributed. Fragility flag *not* triggered — wide expertise pool (>2 experts per workstream) and sufficient volunteer slack in many areas.  
3. **Membrane Scan:** Layers = Debian Project Leader, Technical Committee, Maintainers, General Resolution process. Permeability: Med inbound, High outbound. Friction change: ↔.  
4. **Informal Power Map:** Influence clusters in long-term maintainers and release managers; generally stabilizing.  
5. **Hazards:**  
   - Mode Lock: none.  
   - Context Collapse: minor risk in cross-list discussions.  
   - Membrane Dysfunction: occasional mismatch between TC decisions and maintainer consensus.  
   - Political economy: release timelines impact downstream users.  
6. **Stop Conditions:** No breach; measurements not in excess.  
7. **Equity & Legitimacy:** Representation gap in leadership roles; invisible labor in package triage.

**Result:** Debian’s governance is generally stable in Concurrent+Distributed mode due to deep expertise and volunteer resilience. Main improvement area: address representation gaps and better align Technical Committee decisions with maintainer consensus.
