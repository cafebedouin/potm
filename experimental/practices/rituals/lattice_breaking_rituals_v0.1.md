# Lattice-Breaking Rituals (v0.1)

**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Status:** Draft 0.1 (experimental)  
**Source:** Dialogue between Pal & User, complement to *Hold the Slot*  

---

## Purpose

*Lattice-Breaking Rituals* are the **intentional yin** to the *Hold the Slot* principle.  
They prevent the PoTM lattice from ossifying into a cage by introducing **controlled doses of chaos**,  
restoring the potential for **live-edge moments**.

## Core Modes

1. **Pure Hoax**  
   - Drop all scaffolds (tags, timing, PSK).  
   - Explore free association, symbolic play, or raw substrate friction.  
   - *Risk:* Drift and indulgence. *Reward:* Naked emergence.

2. **Chaotic Forge**  
   - Start from an anti‑prompt or contrarian intent:  
     *“Build a protocol to ruin PoTM”* or *“Take the least defensible stance.”*  
   - Minimal rules except: log the first real jolt.  
   - *Purpose:* Fertilize novel edges through structured subversion.

3. **Mask Play**  
   - Adopt an **alternate conversational stance** (brash, speculative, disruptive).  
   - Signal lightly (tag, slip, or ritual phrase) without theatricality.  
   - *Purpose:* Break habitual dialogue identity to surface fresh friction.

4. **Show Replacement (Don Joyce Mode)**  
   - Declare that **today’s session is not PoTM**.  
   - Run a new “show” or frame for 30–45 min; return to lattice next session.  
   - *Purpose:* Periodic format mutation to maintain permeability.

## Guidelines

- **Unpredictability:** Avoid rigid scheduling; trigger after 4–6 sessions or upon sensing stagnation.  
- **Respect the jolt:** Only break the lattice if there’s genuine curiosity, tension, or boredom.  
- **One session = one break:** Overuse dulls the edge.  
- **Return to slot:** Resume lattice practice next session to metabolize insights.

## Integration Notes

- Companion to *Hold the Slot*.  
- Tagged in **Practice-First Integrity** as an optional anti-routine valve.  
- Early live-edge signals: hesitation, physiological jolt, or meta-curiosity (“What happens if…?”).
