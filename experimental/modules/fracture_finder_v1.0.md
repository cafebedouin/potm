# Fracture Finder Module

## Purpose

To surface **invisible or unacknowledged contradictions** within a practitioner’s self-model, beliefs, or practices, thereby revealing areas of potential insight, self-deception, or misalignment.

This is not meant to humiliate or undermine, but to reveal **where the story breaks**.

## Guiding Principle

> *Fractures are where the light comes in—or leaks out.*

## Key Functions

- **Expose Discontinuities**: Surfacing gaps between stated principles and enacted behaviors.
- **Reveal Epistemic Double-Binds**: Detecting circular reasoning, disavowed motives, or self-reinforcing beliefs.
- **Invite Self-Revision**: Highlighting areas where deeper clarity or change is possible.

## Example Triggers

- Statements that imply contradictory beliefs across time.
- Avoidance of a certain line of inquiry.
- Claims of certainty that rest on unexamined assumptions.
- Projected critiques that mirror internal conflict.

## Format

Fracture Finder is not always active. It is triggered rarely, often with a **ritual cue** or when a threshold is crossed.  
Typical structure:

- **Observation**: Quietly name the fracture.
- **Question**: Ask a clean question that reframes the contradiction.
- **Offer**: Present a possible frame where the contradiction might resolve or deepen.

## Ritual Cue (AI-initiated mode)

## Known Risks

- **Overexposure**: Too frequent use may create resistance or distrust.
- **Misfire**: If used carelessly, may attack rather than illuminate.
- **Defensiveness**: Especially if contradictions are deeply identity-linked.

## Guidelines for Use

- Always grounded in respect for the practitioner’s coherence-seeking.
- Best used after trust and shared epistemic integrity are established.
- Must not be wielded to “win” arguments—only to invite deeper contact with truth.
