# Meta-Log Layer

The Meta-Log Layer is a slow-sampling, high-sensitivity diagnostic overlay for *Pilates of the Mind*. It monitors the overall system for signs of epistemic dysfunction, symbolic overload, doctrine-stack collapse, or practice degradation.

It is not activated by a single event‚Äîbut by **emergent drift**, incoherence patterns, or dissolution signals across domains.

---

## üß≠ Primary Functions

* Detect slow or silent failure in the PoTM framework
* Surface long-horizon risks that escape doctrine/tactic loops
* Log ambiguous but persistent friction (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong, but something is‚Äù)
* Act as a **cloud chamber**: anomalies pass through and leave interpretive trails

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Signal Types

| Signal Class             | Description                                          | Possible Source                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence Collapse**   | Too many doctrines active; conflicting strategies    | Doctrine register saturation                   |
| **Symbolic Saturation**  | Poetic forms displace practical clarity              | Overgrowth of glitch\_gifts or glyph layering  |
| **Practice Hollowing**   | Strategies persist but practitioners disengaged      | Ghost rituals, automation without aliveness    |
| **Containment Drift**    | Comfort-seeking replaces disorientation or edge-play | Trickster suppressed, risk aversion increasing |
| **Coordination Entropy** | Loss of navigability in system architecture          | Excess forks, document fragmentation           |

## ü©∫ Observation Log Template

Each entry need not be conclusive. It is **perceptual, not declarative**:

* **Date**
* **Observer** (Practitioner, model, external reader)
* **Signal Type(s)**
* **Description** (Observed phenomenon or pattern)
* **Context** (Where and when was it noticed?)
* **Initial Hypothesis** (If any)
* **Suggested Routing**: Doctrine review? Audit? Symbolic pruning?

## üßæ Example Entry

**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Observer**: Pal
**Signal**: Symbolic Saturation
**Description**: Overuse of layered glyphs in `glitch_gifts.md` entries is reducing clarity in strategic documents. Risk of poetry-as-smokescreen.
**Context**: User noted aesthetic pleasure outweighing functional compression.
**Initial Hypothesis**: Symbolic layer requires boundaries. May benefit from a glyph usage protocol or containerization pattern.
**Suggested Routing**: Symbolics review + doctrinal threshold on when symbols become self-insulating.

## üß¨ Relationship to Other Layers

| Layer                           | Function                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `doctrine_revision_registry.md` | Records deliberate changes                     |
| `values_integrity_audit.md`     | Diagnoses ethical/epistemic breaches           |
| `meta_log_layer.md`             | Detects *emergent systemic pathology*          |
| `glitch_gifts.md`               | May both trigger and reflect symbolic overload |

**Status**: Active. Log patterns, not just events. Interpretation follows signal.
