## 🧠 Optional Use Cases

* Embed into `README.md` of epistemic systems
* Render as ASCII in plaintext environments
* Annotate individual protocols with their *position* in this loop

## 🧷 Condensed One-Liners by Layer

### ⚡⧉ **Tactics**

*Micro-moves that touch the real.*
→ Breath, pause, labeling—where signal enters.

---

### 🧭⇄ **Strategy**

*Adaptive patterns shaped by terrain.*
→ Protocols and rituals that respond to now.

---

### ✶≠≡ **Doctrine**

*Frames that teach what to notice.*
→ Stances that shape perception over time.

---

### 🜨 **Principles**

*Commitments you’d rather break the system than betray.*
→ Dignity, non-instrumentality, presence.

---

### 🔍⟲ **Meta-Log Layer**

*The system that watches the system breathe.*
→ Detects drift, collapse, saturation, silence.
