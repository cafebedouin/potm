# 🧪 EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENTS

This directory houses **provisional or developmental** materials within the *Pilates of the Mind* framework.

These are live ideas being tested, refined, or evaluated. They may work well in some contexts, fail in others, or raise open questions.

## 🔁 Characteristics

- Useful but unproven
- Still subject to mutation, renaming, or removal
- May contain conflicting assumptions with `core/`
- Often emerged from recent AI-human dialogue
