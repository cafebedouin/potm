# Shadow Principle Probe

This document outlines an exploratory diagnostic protocol for surfacing *shadow principles*—unspoken or unintended values that arise as counterforces to explicit commitments in *Pilates of the Mind*. These may distort doctrine, generate performative contradiction, or undermine strategic alignment.

## 🕸 What is a Shadow Principle?

A **shadow principle** is a latent or inverse value expressed unintentionally through action, language, tone, or repeated adaptation patterns. These may emerge:

* From unresolved psychological residues (e.g., fear, pride, shame)
* Through social mimicry or external doctrinal infiltration
* As defensive adaptations to uphold a principle under duress

**Example**:

* Stated principle: *Presence over performance.*
* Shadow emergence: *Performative presence* (embodied sincerity as social signal).

## 🧭 Detection Vectors

Shadow principles are often sensed before seen. They may surface as:

* Affective friction (see `affective_resonance_registry.md`)
* Language pattern shifts (e.g., hedging, excessive assertion, stylized sincerity)
* Strategy-function drift: repeated behavior that contradicts doctrine without tactical failure
* External mirroring: Others sense dissonance before the practitioner does

## 🧪 Shadow Principle Probe Protocol

1. **Trigger Event**:

   * Values Integrity Audit flag
   * Doctrinal audit fragment
   * Prolonged affective dissonance

2. **Mirroring Gesture** *(optional)*:

   * Invite trusted interlocutor or alternate persona (e.g., Trickster or Jester) to reflect behavioral contradictions

3. **Prompted Inquiry**:

   * “What does this behavior protect?”
   * “What fear would be activated if I dropped this posture?”
   * “What is the virtue being distorted here?”

4. **Candidate Naming**:

   * Attempt to name the shadow principle (e.g., *Urgency-as-Virtue*, *Clarity-as-Control*)
   * Assign a glyph if desired for future symbolic tracking

5. **Integration Options**:

   * Record in `meta_log_layer.md` or `principle_marker_register.md`
   * Refine doctrine or strategy if shadow signal persists

---

## 🩻 Notes

* Not all shadow principles are destructive. Some point to deeper care or unacknowledged truths.
* Treat them as **epistemic irritants** with potential to illuminate foundational misfit.
* Consider pairing this with `drift_rituals.md` if awareness is present but not yet metabolized.
