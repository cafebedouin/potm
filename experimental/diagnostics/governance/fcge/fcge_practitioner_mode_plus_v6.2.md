# Finite Channel with Gated Exchange — v6.2 Practitioner Mode+

**Purpose:** Rapidly diagnose & adjust bounded-capacity systems with explicit gates and role boundaries.  
**Use Case:** Live check (~15 min) for PoTM-style field test.

## 1. Identify the Channel
- Name the system or group.
- State entry/exit rules in 1–2 lines.

## 2. Mode Check
**Axes:**  
- *Process Pacing:* Sequential ↔ Concurrent  
- *Governance Structure:* Centralized ↔ Distributed

**Fragility Flag:**  
- If Sequential+Distributed OR Concurrent+Centralized:  
  → Stable only if BOTH:  
   - **Expertise spread proxy:** ≥2 independent experts per major workstream.  
   - **Slack proxy:** >10% unallocated time/budget.  
  → If not met, flag as fragile.

## 3. Membrane Scan
- List layers (roles/groups).  
- Rate permeability: Low / Med / High.  
- Note friction points and change since last review: ↑ / ↔ / ↓.

## 4. Informal Power Map
- Who has influence outside formal roles?  
- Stabilizing or subversive?  
- Skip if culturally sensitive unless opt-in.  
- Delete mapping after 90 days unless hazard.

## 5. Hazards Quick-Check
- **Mode Lock:** stuck in one mode?  
  [Likely Intervention:] Align incentives, refactor roles.  
- **Context Collapse:** blurred boundaries?  
  [Likely Intervention:] Clarify channels, reset norms.  
- **Membrane Dysfunction:** permeability mismatch?  
  [Likely Intervention:] Add liaisons, revise handoffs.  
- **Political economy hook:** who gains/loses?  
  [Likely Intervention:] Negotiate, increase transparency.

## 6. Stop Conditions
Defaults: N=2 cycles, X=10%, Y=5%. Adjust as needed.  
- No decision change in N cycles.  
- <X% new insight in 2 cycles.  
- Measurement burden >Y% capacity.  
- Enforced by named role/body.

## 7. Equity & Legitimacy Quick-Scan
- Representation gaps (e.g., missing women/minorities in maintainer roles).  
- Life-stage/crisis constraints (e.g., new parent).  
- Compound disadvantages (e.g., junior staff + low language fluency).  
- Invisible labor (e.g., unpaid moderation).  
- Soft power dominance (e.g., recurring agenda-setter without formal role).

**Result:** 2–3 sentence finding: Mode + fragility, key hazard(s), recommended intervention.
