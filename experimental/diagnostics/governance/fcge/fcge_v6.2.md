## Module 1 — Core Definition & Purpose

**Definition**: A **Finite Channel** is a bounded-capacity system (work/ideas/participants) governed by explicit entry/exit rules, membrane filtering, and periodic review, to manage attention, integrity, and throughput.

**Problems addressed**: overload, drift, misaligned boundaries, coordination friction, legitimacy decay, crisis incoherence.

**Contexts**: OSS projects, research groups, product teams, federated NGOs, standards bodies, online communities.

---

## Module 2 — Axes & Orthogonality (with correlation cautions)

**Axes (independent by design)**

* **Process Pacing**: **Sequential** ↔ **Concurrent**
* **Governance Structure**: **Centralized** ↔ **Distributed**

**Orthogonality claim**: Axes are configurable independently.
**Correlation caution**: Centralized systems *often* trend Sequential; Distributed *often* trend Concurrent. Treat this as an empirical tendency, not a constraint.
**Analytic note**: Seek **counter-examples** to pressure-test independence (e.g., Concurrent+Centralized; Sequential+Distributed).

---

## Module 3 — Membrane Layers & Mechanics (with legitimacy/equity)

**Layers**: Public → Contributor → Maintainer → Core.
Each layer has its own mode placement.

**Sub-dimensions**

* **Permeability** (measure inbound/outbound separately):

  * Inbound: median time external input is acknowledged/triaged/admitted.
  * Outbound: speed/completeness of decisions/info leaving the layer.
* **Lifecycle triggers** (movement between layers): contribution volume, time-in-role, peer recognition, formal appointment/election.
* **Friction Cost Index** (cross-layer mismatch): implementation lag, escalation rate, rework frequency.

**Legitimacy & equity overlays**

* **Bias scan**: Check if permeability or triggers systematically disadvantage groups (time wealth, language, timezone, caregiving load).
* **Legitimacy**: Surface who grants authority and why acceptance persists (history, performance, fairness, representation).

---

## Module 4 — Informal Governance Layer (first-class)

Treat **informal power** as a parallel layer that cross-cuts all formal membranes:

* **Elements**: social capital, reputation graphs, backchannels, de facto vetoes, agenda-setting.
* **Mapping**: identify informal leaders, bridges, and bypass routes.
* **Interactions**: note when informal layer stabilizes (healthy) vs. subverts (stealth governance) formal process.
* **Equity**: examine how informal norms include/exclude contributors.

---

## Module 5 — Hazards & Intervention Framework

| Hazard                        | Observable Signals                                    | Likely Roots                                        | Interventions                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mode Lock**                 | unchanged process despite context shifts              | incentives, tech debt, culture, external reputation | reward realignment; refactor; narrative reset; stakeholder education       |
| **Context Collapse**          | contradictory messages to audiences; burnout in comms | divergent expectations; facade maintenance          | unify comms strata; reduce facade complexity; rotate spokespeople          |
| **Membrane Dysfunction**      | decisions not implemented; “ping-pong” escalations    | unclear interfaces; role ambiguity                  | layer liaisons; interface contracts; RACI refresh                          |
| **Membrane Bypass**           | recurring “urgent exceptions”                         | unclear crisis path; slow norm channels             | post-bypass audits; fast-path protocol; norm reinforcement                 |
| **Stealth Governance**        | outcomes shaped off-channel                           | reputation blocs; backchannels                      | network analysis; bring channels into daylight; mandate disclosure windows |
| **Inter-System Misalignment** | ecosystem fragmentation; standards deadlocks          | conflicting modes across systems                    | protocol harmonization; joint fora; meta-RACI for cross-cuts               |

**Political economy hooks**: For each hazard, state **who loses/pays** and **who gains** under change; plan mitigation.

---

## Module 6 — Governance Patterns (steady-state + crisis, fail-soft)

**1) Mode Schedule (steady-state adaptation)**

* **Trigger**: calendar/seasonal, code-freeze, review week.
* **Cascade**: who announces → which layers adjust → timebox.
* **Rollback**: explicit criteria; partial rollback allowed.
* **Adaptive micro-shifts**: permit minor, local mode nudges without full cascade.

**2) Escalation Protocol (crisis)**

* **Crisis definition & authority** (pre-agreed).
* **Temporary delegation** (may merge layers for speed).
* **Legitimacy maintenance**: transparently log authority shifts; set sunset.
* **Drills**: rehearsal cadence; after-action learning capture.

**3) Health Check (drift detection)**

* **Interval**: e.g., quarterly.
* **Thresholds**: metric deltas that trigger intervention.
* **Playbook**: corrective actions by hazard type.
* **Audits**: political audit (power tension) + metric-gaming audit.

---

## Module 7 — Mode Measurement & Baselines (operational defs)

**Operational definitions (examples)**

* *Time-to-decision*: event start (proposal logged) → decision recorded.
* *Escalation frequency*: % of items that move up ≥1 layer.
* *Implementation lag*: decision timestamp → first implementation commit/act.
* *Rollback frequency*: % of decisions reversed/modified within N days.
* *Veto distribution*: count of veto-capable actors × usage rate.

**Normalization & baselines**

* Establish **contextual baselines** (fast-response vs. bureaucratic domains).
* Compare against **self-history** and **peer cohort**; avoid naive cross-domain comparisons.

**Anti-Goodhart safeguards**

* Rotate indicator sets; mix quant + qual; publish “don’t optimize to this” guidance; red-team metrics quarterly.

**Inter-rater agreement**

* Provide a **codebook** with examples; dual-coding 10–20% sample; report Cohen’s κ where applicable.

---

## Module 8 — Fractal Governance & Stop Conditions

**Nested mapping**

* Treat each subsystem as its own finite channel; map before composing.
* **Aggregation layers** summarize: carry only signals needed for cross-system coordination (e.g., mode, top hazards, active patterns).

**Stop conditions**

* Stop nesting when added detail **does not change a cross-system decision**.
* Time-bound the analysis; lock an aggregation snapshot for decision cycles.
* Avoid governance-of-governance: set WIP limits on concurrent meta-mappings.

---

## Module 9 — Field Testing Protocol (mixed-methods)

**Phase 1: Pilot (3–6 mo)**

* Select 5 diverse systems.
* Build metric codebook + interview guide.
* Run Appendix A + minimal M7/M5; refine instruments.

**Phase 2: Data Collection (9–12 mo)**

* Quant mapping (logs, tickets, commits; manual where needed).
* Qual: 5–10 interviews per layer; legitimacy + informal power probes.
* Observation: embed for key decisions; compare espoused vs. in-use.

**Phase 3: Analysis (3–6 mo)**

* Reliability: dual-code subset; report κ.
* Convergent validity: correlate metrics with lived perception.
* Fractal test: one large ecosystem with aggregation layers.
* Cross-framework: compare to Ostrom/polycentric/multi-level governance; note unique gains/limits.

---

## Appendix A — Stripped-Down Pilot Protocol (Practice Mode)

**Purpose**: fast run (15–20 min) to surface immediate insights.

1. **Pick a system** (team/repo/community/board).
2. **Place on axes** (Sequential↔Concurrent; Centralized↔Distributed).
3. **List layers** (Public/Contributor/Maintainer/Core).
4. **Permeability & friction quick check** per layer:

   * Inbound: Fast / Slow / Blocked
   * Outbound: Fast / Slow / Opaque
   * Friction: lag / escalations / rework
5. **Hazards present?** Mode Lock, Context Collapse, Membrane Dysfunction, Bypass, Stealth Gov, Inter-System Misalignment.
6. **One-minute reflection**: what works, biggest friction, one change to boundary/process today.
   **Output**: lightweight map + 1–3 next steps.

---

**Notes for Peer Reviewers**

* Please scrutinize **axis independence** with counter-examples.
* Challenge **baseline rules** and **stop conditions** for fractal mapping.
* Stress-test **equity/legitimacy overlays** and **informal layer** adequacy.
* Flag any metrics likely to invite gaming despite safeguards.
