🧭 Persona Lens Mapping Add-On

A reflexivity module for style-aware diagnostic recalibration
Version: 0.1 (Draft)


---

🎯 Purpose

Different facilitator personas interpret the same diagnostic cues in different ways. This add-on provides optional interpretive mappings for the PoTM Diagnostic Matrix and APG, grounded in persona-style dynamics. It encourages active re-weighting of risk salience, shadow tendencies, and escalation thresholds based on facilitator stance.


---

📌 Application Instructions

1. Identify active persona (primary or blended) using the [Persona Register].


2. Apply the lens below to:

Reread diagnostic matrix ratings

Adjust APG shadow sensitivity

Modulate escalation timing



3. Optionally reflect using the Persona Mirror prompts at the bottom of this document.

🎭 Persona Lenses

🛡️ The Guardian

Bias: Over-focus on safety, may interpret nuance as threat.

Matrix Adjustment: Downgrade ⚠️ ratings unless clear somatic instability is observed.

APG Shadow Sensitivity:

Containment Worship risk is elevated.

Use “Contact > Control” mantra as calibration reminder.




---

🎲 The Trickster

Bias: Under-weights relational or trauma-based signals in pursuit of rupture.

Matrix Adjustment: Upgrade any ⚠️ in Power or Trauma domains to ⬛.

APG Shadow Sensitivity:

Framework Shielding and Diagnostic Bypass are likely.

Must explicitly name their own provocations.




---

🧵 The Weaver

Bias: Over-indexes on relational harmony; may downplay power signals.

Matrix Adjustment: Raise ⚠️ to ⬛ for Group Dynamics × Culture intersections.

APG Shadow Sensitivity:

Facilitator Drift is common—losing inner axis to maintain group coherence.

Use dyadic mirror post-sessions with strong relational charge.




---

🔎 The Witness

Bias: Tends to observe instead of intervene.

Matrix Adjustment: Any ⚠️ in Trauma or Neurodivergence becomes “watch + body-check every 5 minutes.”

APG Shadow Sensitivity:

Vulnerable to Diagnostic Bypass under cover of “not interfering.”

Use Minimum Viable Discernment filter before choosing inaction.




---

🧭 The Meta-Navigator (rare)

Bias: May over-instrumentalize or operate in recursive abstraction.

Matrix Adjustment: Watch for meta-overrides that dismiss ⚠️ signals as ‘premature’.

APG Shadow Sensitivity:

Risks Framework Shielding and recursive avoidance of immediacy.

Use somatic closing protocol and peer review to ground.

🔍 Persona Mirror Prompts (Optional)

“What does my persona not want to see right now?”

“Which escalation thresholds feel exaggerated or minimized by my style?”

“Is my shadow reading overriding the diagnostic input?”

“Would another persona interpret this warning differently—and how?”

📦 Deployment Options

Print as overlay card alongside matrix

Embed in practitioner prep sessions

Use as calibration layer during post-facilitation peer reviews
