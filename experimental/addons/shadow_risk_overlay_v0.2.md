🕳️ Shadow Risk Overlay Add-On

v0.2 – Compact Meta-Diagnostic for Practitioner Distortion


---

🔍 Purpose

This overlay surfaces when your own unconscious tendencies may distort facilitation, risk assessment, or protocol use. It acts as a reflective checkpoint layered onto the Diagnostic Matrix or Advanced Practitioner Guide, especially during ambiguity, tension, or rapid escalation.


---

🧭 When to Use

Before initiating diagnostic triage during complex or emotionally charged sessions.

After facilitation if something felt “off” despite technical success.

If familiar patterns of resistance, conflict, or “deja vu” arise repeatedly.

In mirror zone facilitation—when your own unresolved history resonates with the participant's.

🧬 Shadow Pattern Cross-Map

Shadow Pattern	Distorting Effect	Reflective Safeguard

Framework Shielding	Interpreting resistance as lack of training	Ask: “What if this isn’t about the model?”
Facilitator Drift	Downplaying rupture to maintain flow	Use matrix in writing before session ends
Containment Worship	Escalating too soon to preserve order	Track internal fear signal before responding
Diagnostic Bypass	Over-analyzing to avoid emotional contact	Do 1-minute feeling + body check before speak
Purity Enforcement	Treating mistakes as moral pollution	Recall: “Contact > Purity” design principle
Perpetual Mirror	Avoiding boundary via endless reflection	Reassert agency: “No as closure is valid.”



---

🩺 Somatic Clues of Shadow Activation

Sudden breath-holding or shallow chest breathing

Micro-withdrawal (pulling back posture, folding arms)

Neck or jaw tension, scanning eyes

Over-smiling or flat affect during rupture

Urge to conclude prematurely



---

🔘 Pre-Session Prevention Prompts

Ask these before sessions where you expect edge work:

“What am I subtly hoping won’t happen today?”

“Where am I feeling defensive before we begin?”

“What pattern in them might be mine too?”



---

🧠 Shadow Risk Heuristic

Signal	Risk Level	Immediate Move

Mild sense of posturing or shutdown	⚠️ Caution	Pause + journal or body check
Looping verbal reflection without contact	⬛ Moderate	Consult dyadic mirror partner
Emotional flatness during rupture moment	⬛⬛ High	Full stop + internal review or consult
Reframing escalation as “just process”	🔥 Critical	Trigger Crisis Escalation Protocol



---

🔧 Repair Actions (If Shadow Detected)

Acknowledge the distortion (to self or group)

Pause facilitation if impact persists

Repair with affected parties or co-facilitators

Reflect + log for future pattern mapping

Debrief within 24 hours if harm risk suspected



---

🧩 Integration Tips

Use before consulting the Diagnostic Matrix if you feel unusually confident in your interpretation.

Use after Dyadic Mirror if the same failure mode keeps recurring.

Use during post-facilitation journaling to name blind spots.

✅ Final Notes

This overlay is not a complete shadow work system. It is a precision safety tool—a way to reduce practitioner distortion at the point of contact.

> Shadow work is not introspection. It’s where your unseen motives shape the field.
This overlay lets you see the shape of the field you’re casting.
