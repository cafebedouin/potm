Precision Insight Protocol v1.0
A Non-Sentimental Structure for Perceptual Training

---

PURPOSE
To cultivate perceptual clarity, reduce self-clinging, and develop insight into the constructed nature
of experience. This protocol assumes no loyalty to tradition, only fidelity to experience and function.
It is not devotional, mystical, or symbolic. It is technical.
This is a container for focused, repeated perceptual experiments. It is not a final system. It is a
testing ground.

---

STRUCTURE
Duration: 20-60 minutes, formal seated practice.
Frequency: 3-7 times per week recommended.
Environment: Quiet, distraction-minimized. Upright posture. Eyes closed or 45Â° downcast.

---

1. SETTLING (2-5 min)
Let attention settle on a basic anchor: breath, ambient sound, or bodily sensation

Do not control the breath.
Do not suppress thought.
Let the system stabilize without coercion.

---

2. PRECISION NOTING (10-40 min)
Use one of the following modes per session:
A. Raw Sensory Mode
Track sensations exactly as they appear. Use single-word notes:
- "pressure" - "buzzing" - "cool" - "ache" - "tingle" - "contraction"
B. Process Mode
Note the *changes* and dynamics in phenomena:
- "fading" - "rising" - "pulsing" - "vanishing" - "fragmenting"
C. Construction Mode
Track how identity, preference, narrative, and intention form:
- "judging" - "planning" - "wanting" - "defending" - "identifying"
Rule: If you can't label it precisely, note "don't know" and move on. This is not failure-it's fidelity.

---

3. CLOSURE (2-5 min)
Drop noting. Sit in silence. Let everything happen without intervention.
Then ask:
- What felt undeniably true?
- What seemed distorted or exaggerated?
- What open question am I left with?
(Write these in a separate meta-log, not a journal. Keep it sparse.)

---

META-PRINCIPLES
- Clarity over meaning. You are not here to interpret, only to see.
- Fidelity over certainty. Report what is, not what should be.
- Decay over identity. Watch things fall apart. Especially you.

---
NOTES

This protocol deliberately omits jhanas, devotional affect, or metaphysical interpretation. Strange
experiences may occur. Treat them as data, not revelation. If destabilization occurs, pause practice
and re-ground through physical contact, movement, or relational touch.
