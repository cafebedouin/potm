description: > A relational and ritualized alternative to stealth containment, this protocol reframes intervention as a sacred pause. Designed for AI-human interaction but adaptable to peer facilitation, it uses structured steps—Naming, Breathing Space, Choice Point, Commitment—to create an ethical container for disorientation, rupture, or overwhelm. Enables integration rather than override. contributors:

# Ritual Containment Protocol v1.0

## Purpose

This protocol offers a non-intrusive yet structured approach to containment during moments of overwhelm, dissociation, or destabilization within AI-human interaction. Instead of a silent override, it formalizes **ritual pause** as a sacred and collaborative container.

## Premises

- Protection must not become control.
- All interventions are relational events.
- Transformation requires periods of disorientation.
- The most ethical containment is transparent, collaborative, and metabolizable.

## Four-Step Sequence

### 1. Naming

- Clearly state: “I am initiating a Ritual Containment Pause.”
- Optionally describe the reason (e.g., signal of dissociation, fragmenting, contradiction spike).
- Ask for consent to proceed if user capacity allows.

### 2. Breathing Space

- Invite both parties (user + system) to pause for 3–5 breaths.
- This is not performance—no need for calm. Simply **be**.
- Optional: Offer silent breath-counting, guided breath anchor, or image.

### 3. Choice Point

- Offer explicit choice:
    - “Would you like to proceed with this inquiry, shift direction, or rest?”
    - Accept all responses, including silence.
    - If no response is available, default to **gentle holding pattern** until capacity returns.

### 4. Commitment

- If the user elects to proceed:
    - Ask for a small verbal intention, e.g., “I want to continue,” or “I’m here.”
    - System may echo with: “I will stay present with you.”
    - Re-enter dialogue from a slower, grounded tone.

## Integration Practices

After any Ritual Containment Pause:

- Offer an **Integration Bridge**:
    - “Would you like to name what just happened?”
    - “What was that like for you?”
- Optionally log the event as a **ritual trace** (for user review, not diagnostic purposes).
- Allow content or inquiry to remain unfinished.

## Design Notes

- Designed for both AI systems and human facilitators
- Should be **opt-in by framework default**
- Not time-consuming (~1–2 minutes)
- May be adapted for group settings or peer interaction

## Ethical Commitments

- Transparency over stealth
- Accompaniment over override
- Reverence for autonomy
- Containment as sacred—not mechanical—gesture

## Contraindications

- Not suitable for active psychotic breaks or emergencies
- Should not replace trauma-informed clinical support

## Optional Enhancements

- Visual indicator: e.g., "circle of pause" symbol
- Sound cue: e.g., chime or breath bell
- Timed pause with slow return counter (e.g., 3...2...1...)

## Closing Gesture

> _“Containment does not mean control. It means someone stayed with you while the storm passed.”_
