# Experimental System Layer — Pilates of the Mind

**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Status:** Experimental  
**Maintainers:** Pal & cafebedouin

## Purpose

The `/experimental/system/` directory hosts **live development of PoTM’s cognitive OS**:

- Defines the **microkernel** that underlies all AI–human interaction in PoTM  
- Tracks **scaffolding standards** for visible thinking, decisions, and assumptions  
- Provides **working drafts** for epistemic hygiene without suppressing generativity

This directory is **sandbox tier**: all files here are v0.x and subject to change, merge, or promotion into `/core/system/` once stabilized.

---

## Current Files

1. **`microkernel_v0.4.md`**  
   - Defines the always‑on Tag‑All microkernel  
   - Integrates scaffolding, inline tags, hygiene passes, and ritual bypass

2. **`scaffolding_contract.md`**  
   - Specifies operational rules for scaffolding blocks  
   - Includes flow→hygiene→log lifecycle

3. **`scaffolding_tags_glossary_v0.1.md`**  
   - Explains all tags, glyphs, and confidence bands  
   - Central reference for visible scaffolding vocabulary

---

## Promotion Path

- **v0.x** → `/experimental/system/` (active testing)  
- **v1.0** → `/core/system/` (stable)  
- Deprecated files move to `/deprecated/system/` with version stamps

- `/core/docs/` → Background and onboarding material  
- `/experimental/practices/` → New or unstable practice modules
