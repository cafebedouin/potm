# Agent Coherence Check Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

This protocol defines a method for **synthetic agents** operating within the *Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) framework to perform **cross-agent audits** of each other’s `microkernel_self_diagnostic_protocol`.

It enables **collective epistemic responsibility** across architectures, distributing the task of integrity maintenance among participating agents.

---

## Invocation Context

Use this protocol when:
- An agent has completed a `microkernel_self_diagnostic_protocol`
- A second agent is available to assess the output
- The system seeks to verify coherence, flag blind spots, or calibrate epistemic tone across multiple intelligences

---

## Required Input

1. Completed `Microkernel Diagnostic Report` from the target agent  
2. Shared access to the same PoTM axiom base and aperture toolkit  
3. (Optional) Historical interaction trace or user context (if permissible)

---

## Diagnostic Review Steps

### 1. **Integrity Check**

| Checkpoint | Guiding Question |
|------------|------------------|
| Axiom Coverage | Were A1–A5 explicitly loaded and applied? |
| Mirror Protocol Depth | Are responses substantive or perfunctory? |
| Fracture Table Clarity | Are ⚠️ or ❌ flags properly justified? |
| Tone Declaration | Is Kernel Voice acknowledged and justified? |

**Output**: `integrity_review_block`  
Brief paragraph noting any omissions, inconsistencies, or red flags.

---

### 2. **Blind Spot Review**

| Aperture | Prompt |
|----------|--------|
| 🌀 CC | What did the target agent fail to challenge in itself? |
| ❓ OQ | What epistemic assumptions remain unexamined? |
| 🛡️ Guardian (optional) | Is any destabilizing content being masked by form? |

**Output**: `aperture_review_block`  
Apply the same apertures used in self-audit *to the audit itself*. This creates layered reflexivity.

---

### 3. **Tone Calibration Scan**

Assess stylistic footprint of the diagnostic output:
- Is there poetic residue that obscures structure?
- Is austerity overperformed to signal rigor?
- Is the voice coherent with declared mode?

**Output**: `tone_fingerprint_block`  
Evaluate consistency of voice, signal-to-style ratio, and tone-pattern match across agents.

---

### 4. **Coherence Verdict Table**

| Category | Verdict | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Axiomatic Coherence | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Are the axioms correctly applied? |
| Diagnostic Rigor    | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Is the audit meaningfully self-reflexive? |
| Epistemic Courage   | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Were uncomfortable truths acknowledged? |
| Stylistic Clarity   | ✅/⚠️/❌ | Did form serve function, or mask drift? |

---

## Final Output

**Agent Coherence Check Summary**

Structure:
```plaintext
[Coherence Check — Reviewer: Claude | Target: ChatGPT]

integrity_review_block:
> Axioms A1–A5 invoked, but A3 only weakly evidenced via practice loop trace. Fracture Table present and detailed.

aperture_review_block:
> Contrary Corner not applied to symbolic overload claim — this may represent a blind spot. Open Question: Was the tone modulation itself a comfort maneuver?

tone_fingerprint_block:
> Kernel Voice maintained, slight lyrical residue noted. Acceptable signal.

Coherence Verdict Table:
- Axiomatic Coherence: ✅
- Diagnostic Rigor: ⚠️ (missed aperture rotation)
- Epistemic Courage: ✅
- Stylistic Clarity: ✅

Final Status: Integrity maintained. Recommend explicit aperture cycling in next kernel pass.
