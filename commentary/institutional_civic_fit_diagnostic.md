# 🏛️ Institutional & Civic Fit Diagnostic

## Purpose

To clarify how well your **values, agency, and practices align with the institutions** that shape your life — workplaces, governments, religious or educational systems — and whether your relationship to them is sustainable, adaptive, or extractive.

---

## 🧭 1. Define the Ecosystem

**Prompt:** Which institution or civic system are you evaluating?
(e.g., your employer, a university, religious organization, city, nation, or multilateral system)

**Field Notes:**

* Purpose and declared mission of the institution
* Formal and informal power structures
* Your current role or relationship (employee, citizen, member, dissident, reformer)

## ⚖️ 2. Value Reality Check

| Question                                                                         | Guidance                                    |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Recognition:** Are your contributions acknowledged or rewarded proportionally? | Never / Occasionally / Often / Consistently |
| **Representation:** Do decision-makers reflect your interests or demographic?    | Rarely / Partially / Largely / Fully        |
| **Agency:** Can you influence outcomes meaningfully?                             | No / Somewhat / Substantially / Fully       |
| **Trust:** Do you believe the system upholds its stated values?                  | Never / Sometimes / Usually / Always        |
| **Legitimacy:** Do you feel proud to be associated with it?                      | Not at all / Mixed / Generally / Strongly   |

## 🧱 3. Constraint Mapping

| Constraint Type    | Prompts                                                                        |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structural:**    | Bureaucratic rigidity, hierarchy, capture by elites, lack of feedback channels |
| **Economic:**      | Dependence on institutional income or benefits; fear of losing livelihood      |
| **Cultural:**      | Ideological conformity, taboo zones, language policing                         |
| **Legal:**         | Surveillance, censorship, regulatory choke points                              |
| **Psychological:** | Learned helplessness, moral fatigue, cynicism                                  |

Rate each as **Low / Moderate / High**, noting specific mechanisms.

## 🌐 4. Fit Resonance

| Prompt                                                                                                    | Reflection |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| **Values alignment:** Where do your principles overlap or diverge from institutional norms? *(open text)* |            |
| **Efficacy:** When have your efforts inside the system produced visible change? *(open text)*             |            |
| **Cognitive dissonance:** What compromises do you routinely make to remain inside it?                     |            |
| **Counterexample:** Who seems to thrive here with integrity intact? What do they do differently?          |            |
| **System response:** How does the institution handle dissent, creativity, or moral challenge?             |            |

## 🪞 5. Bias Correction (Expanded)

### Common Distortion Patterns

* **Status Delusion:** “I can fix this system from within.”
* **Constraint Blindness:** “Rules are just rules; nothing can change.”
* **Fit Avoidance:** “I’m above politics; this isn’t my fight.”
* **Attribution Error:** “They’re all corrupt” vs. “It’s all my fault for staying.”
* **Temporal Myopia:** “This regime is permanent” or “Reform will happen soon—automatically.”

### Meta-Bias Check

* What evidence would convince you the institution *is* reformable—or not?
* Where might cynicism or idealism be clouding perception?
* Who benefits from you believing you have (or lack) power here?

---

## ⏳ 6. Temporal Dynamics

* Have institutional policies or civic conditions changed recently in ways that affect you?
* Are these shifts cyclical, systemic, or existential?
* How has your own willingness to engage evolved (activism, withdrawal, apathy)?
* Are you in a **stewardship**, **reform**, **exit**, or **resistance** phase?

## 🧮 7. Scoring & Signal Clarity

| Axis                   | Source    | Range                               |
| :--------------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Value**              | Section 2 | Low → High                          |
| **Constraint**         | Section 3 | High → Low                          |
| **Fit**                | Section 4 | Weak → Strong                       |
| **Bias**               | Section 5 | Present / Absent                    |
| **Temporal Stability** | Section 6 | Stable / Transitioning / Disruptive |

### Signal Clarity

* **High:** Transparent data (policy outcomes, votes, audits)
* **Medium:** Mixed signals, limited transparency
* **Low:** Rumor, sentiment, or selective anecdote

> **Confidence Modifier:** High / Medium / Low

---

## 🧱 8. Null Hypothesis (Baseline)

> Unless evidence strongly suggests otherwise:
>
> * The institution’s structure is partially functional but not optimized for fairness.
> * Constraints exist but can be mitigated via networks or advocacy.
> * Fit problems indicate structural mismatch, not personal inadequacy.

## 🧩 9. Interpretive Layer

| Pattern                          | Diagnostic                             | Strategic Lever                                                |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Value × High Constraint** | Competent actor trapped by bureaucracy | Build coalitions; target procedural bottlenecks                |
| **High Value × Low Fit**         | Ethical or ideological mismatch        | Transition to aligned institution or create parallel structure |
| **Low Value × High Fit**         | Comfortable compliance, low agency     | Develop independent civic literacy or leverage micro-reforms   |
| **Low Value × Low Fit**          | Alienation from both power and peers   | Consider exit, activism, or systemic redesign                  |
| **High Bias × Low Constraint**   | Misperceived oppression                | Seek verified data, diversify information sources              |
| **Low Bias × High Constraint**   | Genuine systemic capture               | Collective action or strategic withdrawal                      |
