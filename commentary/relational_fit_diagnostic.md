Absolutely — here’s a **repo-ready companion document** to pair with your *Dating Market Diagnostic Tool*.
It’s written in your canonical PoTM diagnostic format, designed to measure *relational fit dynamics* once a relationship (or potential relationship) exists — complementing the *market positioning* layer with an *in-relationship calibration* layer.

# 💞 Relational Fit Diagnostic

## Purpose

To provide a **structured reflection tool** for assessing compatibility and alignment *within* a relationship or emerging connection.
This diagnostic complements the *Dating Market Diagnostic Tool*, focusing not on positioning but on **fit, friction, and forward potential**.

---

## 🧭 Preamble

This tool is best used:

* When evaluating an active relationship or early stage connection (2+ weeks of regular interaction).
* When emotional intensity or uncertainty is high and you want structural clarity.
* Either solo (self-reflection) or jointly (mutual assessment).

## 4. Narrative & Story Alignment

* **Shared story check:**
  When you imagine explaining this relationship to a close friend, what story do you tell? *(open text)*

* **Individual story check:**
  What story do you think your partner would tell? *(open text)*

* **Cross-comparison:**
  How aligned are those two stories?

  * Almost identical
  * Similar themes but different emphasis
  * Divergent
  * Contradictory

*(This section reveals hidden asymmetries in narrative framing and relational investment.)*

| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Fit / Low Constraint**  | Relationship in optimal balance                       | Deepen shared vision; maintain autonomy                     |
| **High Fit / High Constraint** | Strong chemistry but logistical or emotional friction | Identify constraint levers; test structural fixes           |
| **Low Fit / Low Constraint**   | Easy coexistence without spark                        | Decide if comfort suffices or if deeper resonance is needed |
| **Low Fit / High Constraint**  | Repeated exhaustion or confusion                      | Consider containment, pause, or redefinition                |
| **Divergent Narratives**       | Mismatched meaning frameworks                         | Conduct a “story alignment conversation”                    |
| **Unstable Emotional Climate** | Excessive volatility                                  | Prioritize safety before further investment                 |

| **Low Market Value × Low Relational Fit**   | Broad recalibration needed — value cultivation + relational retraining               |
