# ⚖️ Fit–Constraint Diagnostic Framework

## Purpose

To provide a **universal diagnostic scaffold** for understanding how personal or systemic value interacts with constraints to produce varying degrees of fit, opportunity, or mismatch.

---

## 1. Define the Ecosystem

**Prompt:** Who or what comprises the environment in which you’re seeking resonance?
(e.g., dating pool, job market, creative audience, community network)

**Field Notes:**

* Scale (local / regional / global)
* Key decision makers or gatekeepers
* Normative values shaping “success”

---

## 2. Value Reality Check

* How visible or sought after are your contributions in this ecosystem?
* What evidence signals genuine recognition (invitations, offers, collaborations)?
* Compared to peers, where do you over- or under-perform?
* Where does demand exceed supply for your qualities?

---

## 3. Constraint Mapping

* Structural: geography, economics, gatekeeping, hierarchy
* Temporal: timing, bandwidth, stage of life or project
* Cultural: norms, aesthetics, ideology
* Internal: self-doubt, risk aversion, misaligned expectations

---

## 4. Fit Resonance

* In which sub-contexts does your profile seem to “click”?
* What are counter-examples — people unlike you who thrive? What do they reveal about the system’s values?
* Where have you historically felt *seen and effective*?

---

## 5. Bias Correction

* What story do you tell yourself about why things aren’t working?
* What story would a neutral observer tell instead?
* Which of the following distortions apply?

  * Status delusion
  * Constraint blindness
  * Fit avoidance
  * Externalization

---

## 6. Temporal Dynamics

* Has your opportunity landscape improved, declined, or shifted recently?
* What macro changes (technology, culture, demography) are altering the field?
* What personal readiness changes are emerging (motivation, clarity, resilience)?

---

## 7. Scoring Schema

| Axis                   | Output Range                        | Meaning                              |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Value**              | Low → High                          | Market or ecosystem recognition      |
| **Constraint**         | High → Low                          | Structural & psychological barriers  |
| **Fit**                | Weak → Strong                       | Resonance between identity and field |
| **Bias**               | Present / Absent                    | Cognitive distortion layer           |
| **Temporal Stability** | Stable / Transitioning / Disruptive | Direction of change                  |

---

## 8. Middle-Band Diagnostics

If results are inconclusive:

* **Reference Calibration:** Are you comparing against the right peer set?
* **Undervaluation Signal:** Are you under-recognized for structural, not intrinsic, reasons?
* **Forced Repositioning:** If you had to pivot tomorrow, where would you go?

## 9. Interpretive Layer

| Pattern                          | Diagnostic                            | Strategic Lever                                        |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Value × High Constraint** | Latent opportunity trapped by barrier | Remove bottlenecks; test constraint elasticity         |
| **Low Value × High Fit**         | Deep niche potential                  | Double down on resonance zones                         |
| **High Value × Low Fit**         | Mismatch between offer and ecosystem  | Reposition or redefine target field                    |
| **Low Value × Low Fit**          | Rebuild from fundamentals             | Re-skill, re-contextualize, or pause for recalibration |
| **Unstable Temporal Axis**       | Rapid change field                    | Focus on flexibility and exploration                   |

## 10. Integration Points

This framework underlies and generalizes:

* [`dating_market_diagnostic_tool.md`](../dating_market_diagnostic_tool.md)
* [`relational_fit_diagnostic.md`](../relational_fit_diagnostic.md)
* Forthcoming domains: `career_fit_diagnostic.md`, `creative_ecosystem_fit.md`

**Lineage**

> **forge_origin:** dating_market_tool + relational_fit_diagnostic
> **spiral_eval:** generalized meta-framework abstraction v1.0
