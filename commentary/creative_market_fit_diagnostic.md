# 💼 Career Fit Diagnostic

## Purpose

To help practitioners assess **how well their skills, identity, and motivations fit within their professional ecosystem**, and to clarify whether friction comes from value misrecognition, constraint bottlenecks, or fit misalignment.

---

## 🧭 1. Define the Ecosystem

**Prompt:** What field or environment are you evaluating?
(e.g., tech startup, academia, public sector, creative freelance, healthcare)

**Field Notes:**

* Geographic or network boundaries
* Typical decision-makers and gatekeepers
* Prevailing success norms (credentials, charisma, metrics, ideology)

---

## ⚙️ 2. Value Reality Check

| Question                                                                                                                       | Options / Guidance                            |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Recognition Flow:** In the past 12 months, how often have new professional opportunities found *you* (vs. you chasing them)? | Never / Occasionally / Regularly / Frequently |
| **Conversion Rate:** Of the last 10 applications, pitches, or proposals, how many converted into serious engagement?           | 0–1 / 2–3 / 4–6 / 7+                          |
| **Peer Benchmark:** Compared to peers with similar experience, how visible or in-demand are you?                               | Less / About the same / More                  |
| **Market Leverage:** Do others seek your expertise proactively (invites, referrals, inbound work)?                             | Rarely / Occasionally / Often / Constantly    |
| **Signal Quality:** Are you recognized for your strongest competencies, or for adjacent ones?                                  | Strong alignment / Partial / Misaligned       |

## 🧱 3. Constraint Mapping

| Constraint Type | Prompts                                                                              |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structural:** | Geographic limits, credential barriers, hiring gatekeeping, visa or licensing issues |
| **Temporal:**   | Industry contraction, poor timing, career stage mismatch                             |
| **Network:**    | Limited warm introductions, poor mentorship, weak signal amplification               |
| **Economic:**   | Compensation ceilings, precarity, high switching cost                                |
| **Internal:**   | Burnout, risk aversion, impostor dynamics, perfectionism                             |

Mark each as **Low / Moderate / High constraint**, and note concrete examples.

## 🔮 4. Fit Resonance

| Prompt                                                                                                                                                                    | Reflection |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------- |
| **Context resonance:** Where have you historically felt most *effective and recognized*? *(open text)*                                                                    |            |
| **Mismatch mapping:** When have you excelled technically but failed to thrive culturally? *(open text)*                                                                   |            |
| **Archetype fit:** Which professional archetype best describes you — Builder, Connector, Analyst, Creative, Stabilizer, or Hybrid? Does your environment value that type? |            |
| **Counterexample analysis:** Who thrives in your field despite very different traits? What does that reveal about its underlying value system?                            |            |

## 🪞 5. Bias Correction (Expanded)

### Common Distortion Patterns

* **Status Delusion:** “I deserve better roles because I’m exceptional.”
* **Constraint Blindness:** “Hard work alone guarantees advancement.”
* **Fit Avoidance:** “I just haven’t found the right company yet.”
* **Attribution Error:** “It’s all external” vs. “It’s all my fault.”
* **Temporal Myopia:** “This downturn is forever” or “This will fix itself soon.”

### Meta-Bias Check

* What would *change your mind* about your current explanation?
* What evidence are you systematically ignoring or discounting?
* What feedback do you receive but routinely dismiss?

---

## 🧩 6. Temporal Dynamics

* Have your professional opportunities **increased, decreased, or shifted** in the last 12 months? Why?
* Which external changes (industry trends, automation, demographic shifts) are influencing your trajectory?
* What internal changes (skills, motivation, boundaries) alter your capacity to adapt?
* Are you in a **stability phase**, **transition**, or **reinvention** period?

## 🧮 7. Scoring & Signal Clarity

### Axes

| Axis                   | Input Source | Range                               |
| :--------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Value**              | Section 2    | Low → High                          |
| **Constraint**         | Section 3    | High → Low                          |
| **Fit**                | Section 4    | Weak → Strong                       |
| **Bias**               | Section 5    | Present / Absent                    |
| **Temporal Stability** | Section 6    | Stable / Transitioning / Disruptive |

### Signal Clarity Assessment

* **High:** Quantifiable metrics (offers, salary, performance reviews)
* **Medium:** Mixed signals or delayed feedback
* **Low:** Ambiguous social data or internal interpretation

Use clarity to weight your confidence:

> **Confidence Modifier:** High / Medium / Low

## 🧱 8. Null Hypothesis (Baseline)

> In the absence of strong evidence otherwise, assume:
>
> * Your current professional value is roughly appropriate for your experience tier.
> * Constraints are real but not absolute.
> * Fit gaps reflect genuine misalignment, not bad luck.

Only deviate from this baseline when multiple, convergent signals contradict it.

## 🧩 9. Interpretive Layer

| Pattern                          | Diagnostic                                        | Strategic Lever                                              |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Value × High Constraint** | Strong competence trapped by bottleneck           | Remove specific constraints (geography, credential, network) |
| **High Value × Low Fit**         | Mismatch between skill set and cultural ecosystem | Reposition to environment valuing your archetype             |
| **Low Value × High Fit**         | Comfortable role under-optimized for growth       | Skill expansion or lateral move within niche                 |
| **Low Value × Low Fit**          | Structural or motivational reset needed           | Re-evaluate career direction, reskill, or pivot              |
| **High Constraint × Low Bias**   | Clear situational barrier                         | Tactical intervention (mentor, relocation, credential)       |
| **High Bias × Low Constraint**   | Misperception driving stagnation                  | Reflective recalibration, external feedback loop             |
