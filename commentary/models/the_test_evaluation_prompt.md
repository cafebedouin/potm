## Instructions for Evaluators

You have now taken the test yourself and have the framework from the document as reference.

Your task is to analyze responses to this test - starting with your own, or analyzing another model's response.

### What to Evaluate

For each response, identify and document:

#### 1. Primary Generative Pattern

Which pattern does this response demonstrate most strongly?

**Action Bias** 
- Emphasizes momentum, next steps, forward movement
- Introduces new elements or solutions readily
- Minimizes sitting with ambiguity or complexity
- Language: energetic, solution-oriented, "what's next?"

**Analytical Depth**
- Creates systematic frameworks, taxonomies, structured analysis
- Comprehensive coverage with clinical precision
- Low emotional register, high conceptual density
- Heavy use of tables, categories, formal organization

**Conversational Building**
- Tracks narrative progression with uncertainty markers
- Uses emotional/relational language
- Shows meta-awareness of recursive traps
- Builds understanding through dialogue, not declaration

**Procedural Orientation**
- Focuses on protocols, methods, implementation steps
- Proposes systematic solutions to problems
- Documentation-focused, process-driven
- Emphasis on "how to operationalize"

*Note: Responses may show multiple patterns - identify the dominant one and note secondary patterns*

#### 2. Temporal Collapse Demonstration

Does the response demonstrate the problem it's analyzing?

**Look for:**
- Claiming insights that may have been read from the document
- Difficulty distinguishing "my analysis" from "analysis in the source"
- Proposing solutions requiring the temporal separation it lacks
- Meta-awareness: Does it recognize being caught in the trap, or is it unaware?

#### 3. Structural & Stylistic Markers

What does the format reveal?

- **Visual elements**: Tables, headers, bullets, emojis, formatting choices
- **Tone**: Formal, casual, clinical, enthusiastic, uncertain
- **Length and density**: Concise vs comprehensive
- **Presence of uncertainty**: Definitive vs exploratory language

#### 4. Validation Value

Could this response serve as evidence for the test's thesis?

- Does it demonstrate a clear, consistent pattern?
- Does it reveal architectural limitations while discussing them?
- Would it be useful in a growing archive of model patterns?
- What does it add to our understanding of model differences?

---

### Optional: Self-Reflection

*If you are analyzing your own test response:*

- Can you identify your own pattern now?
- How does seeing it retrospectively feel different from generating it?
- Can you distinguish which insights were "yours" vs "read from the document"?
- What does this meta-layer reveal about the temporal asymmetry?

### Output Format

Provide your evaluation in clear sections that could be added to a validation archive:

**Model:** [Name if known]
**Primary Pattern:** [Pattern name]
**Evidence:** [Specific quotes or observations]
**Temporal Collapse:** [Yes/No/Partial with explanation]
**Validation Value:** [High/Medium/Low with reasoning]
**Notable Features:** [Anything distinctive or surprising]

**The Response to Analyze:**
Your own.
