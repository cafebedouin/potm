To provide a **structured self-diagnostic** for assessing your position in the romantic or dating market.

**Outputs:**

* Quadrant (Value × Constraints)

* Best lever (Status / Constraint / Fit)
* Bias flags
* Confidence level

---

## 🧭 Preamble

Before answering, **define your dating pool**: Who are the people you realistically meet and date (geography, culture, community, orientation)? Keep that group in mind throughout.

| **Reciprocation** — In the last 10 people you expressed interest in, how many reciprocated?                   | 0–1 / 2–3 / 4–6 / 7+                                                  |
| **Relative attention** — Compared to others in your pool, how often do you get unsolicited romantic interest? | Much less / Somewhat less / About average / Somewhat more / Much more |
| **Peer comparison** — Think of 3 similar people in your pool. How do their romantic outcomes compare?         | They struggle more / About the same / Somewhat better / Much better   |

## 2. Constraint Mapping (Constraint Axis)

| Question                                                                                          | Options                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Source of prospects** — % of romantic prospects from new vs. existing network                   | 90% existing / 70% existing / 50/50 / 70% new / 90% new                   |
| **Geographic flexibility** — How far would you travel to meet a partner?                          | Walkable / Across town / Nearby city / Anywhere                           |
| **Barriers** — If you wanted to meet 10 new partners this month, what are your biggest obstacles? | Don’t know where / Geographic / Social or cultural / Time / Nothing major |
| **Cultural/religious limits** — How much do norms limit your options?                             | Not at all / Somewhat / Significantly                                     |

## 3. Fit Analysis (Value Resonance)

* **Validation sources:** Where have others given you the strongest positive feedback?
  Options: professional / creative / fitness / academic / social / online
* **Best past context:** When you’ve had your best romantic experiences, what was different about that context? *(open text)*

---

## 4. Bias Correction (Self-Stories)

* Complete: “If I just ____, dating would work much better for me.” *(open text)*
* Why didn’t your last few romantic interests work out?
  Options: They weren’t interested / Wrong timing / Incompatible / I wasn’t ready

**Quadrant Placement:** Q1–Q4 or Middle band
**Confidence:** Clear / Likely / Ambiguous / Insufficient

---

## 🟨 Middle-Case Addendum (For Ambiguous Profiles)

If results place you in the **Middle band** (neither clearly high/low value nor clearly high/low constraint), explore these:

### Differentiator Probes

* **Reference Group Check:**
  When you say “average,” who are you comparing to?

  * Local peers
  * Broader peer group
  * Online/idealized references
    *(Distinguishes “truly average” from miscalibrated comparison.)*

### Undervaluation Signals

Do you notice small, consistent signs that your traits are **under-recognized**?

* Yes, often
* Occasionally
* Rarely / Never
  *(Reveals whether “average” status masks a fit mismatch.)*

### Forced Repositioning

If you had to shift your dating efforts tomorrow into a single niche/community, where would you go? *(open text)*
*(Forces articulation of latent fit opportunities.)*

| Pattern                 | Diagnostic                                                | Strategy                                               |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **True Middle**         | Q1 = local peers, Q2 = rarely undervalued, Q3 = vague     | Incremental self-improvement or gradual pool expansion |
| **Masked Fit Mismatch** | Q1 = online reference, Q2 = undervalued, Q3 = clear niche | Reposition into niche where traits weigh more heavily  |
