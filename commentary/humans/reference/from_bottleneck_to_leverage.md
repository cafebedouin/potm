# 🌱 From Bottleneck to Leverage

**Practice:**  
Instead of asking *“What’s blocking me?”*, scan for leverage, curiosity, or resistance to decide where to place your next bit of attention.

---

### 🔍 1. Map the Terrain
- **Body** → tension, breath, energy, movement  
- **Emotion** → access, depth, expression  
- **Mind** → clarity, focus, thought patterns  
- **Context** → relationships, work, environment  

---

### 🎲 2. Three Angles
- **Leverage** → *What shift might ripple most widely?*  
- **Curiosity** → *What feels most alive or engaging to explore?*  
- **Resistance** → *What keeps calling for attention despite my avoidance?*  

*(Note: Leverage and resistance often overlap — what you avoid may be the most potent lever.)*

---

### 🌱 3. Choose a Frame
- **Leverage →** efficiency & strategic growth  
- **Curiosity →** play & discovery  
- **Resistance →** shadow & integration  

---

### 🌀 4. Experiment (Lightly)
Pick one practice aligned with your chosen frame.  
Run it as a **small experiment**, not a fix.  
Reflect briefly: did it open space? shift tone? call for another step?  

---

**Remember:** You can’t always predict the biggest lever. Sometimes a small, playful shift moves more than the “serious” one.

---

### Lineage
- **Forge origin:** Developed in live conversation (problem-focus → leverage-focus reframing).  
- **Spiral evaluation:** Refined through Claude’s review and translation into both card and guide formats.  
- **Current form:** Split into quick reference (card) and plain-language guide for practitioners.
