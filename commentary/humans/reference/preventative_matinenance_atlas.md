# Preventive Maintenance Atlas

> *"Silent problems are those that matter but do not demand attention loudly. The Atlas exists to surface them, without prescribing what must be acted upon."*

This Atlas maps domains where **silent drift** is common, offering practitioners a reference terrain.  
It is maximalist by design: autonomy is preserved by laying out many options, not by narrowing choice.

## Domains of Drift

### 1. Health & Body
- Annual physical exam  
- Twice-yearly dental cleaning + checkup  
- Vision check every 1–2 years  
- Annual bloodwork (lipids, glucose, etc.)  
- Seasonal fitness assessment (mobility, endurance, strength)  
- Quarterly sleep log review  
- Monthly stress/burnout self-check  

### 2. Relationships & Social Health
- Annual relationship audit (see Relationship Checklist)  
- Quarterly friend check-ins (calls, visits)  
- Biannual family ties reflection  
- Monthly partner/close-friend “state of us” chat  
- Seasonal professional network review (who has drifted?)  

### 3. Financial Health

- Monthly journal check: “What feels unresolved?”  
- Seasonal reflection retreat or silent day  

### 7. Civic & Community Engagement
- Annual civic audit: voting, donations, volunteering  
- Biannual community ties review (clubs, orgs, gatherings)  
- Annual reflection: “Am I contributing where I live?”  

### 8. Risk & Contingency

## Meta-Layers

- **Spiral Catcher**: Flag recurring journal themes — what keeps resurfacing?  
- **Silent Drift Watch**: Set reminders for domains least likely to resurface on their own (e.g., insurance, estate planning).

## Ethical Alignment

This Atlas embodies **Gildor’s Paradox**:  
- Lay out broadly, suggest lightly, never coerce.  
- Respect practitioner autonomy in deciding relevance.  
- Lists are **transparent, reflexive, finite, and non-final** — they guide, not bind.

## Closing Note

The Atlas is not a prescription.  
It is a lantern held high: illuminating the terrain of silent problems so practitioners can choose their own path.
