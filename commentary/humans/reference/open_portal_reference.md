# Open Portal — Direction

**Purpose:**  
Create a safe, open space for collaborative or creative thinking before moving to evaluation or decision-making.  

**When to Use:**  
- Brainstorming new ideas.  
- Exploring sensitive topics without immediate commitment.  
- Breaking habitual debate patterns.  

**How to Use:**  
1. **State Intent** – Signal you want exploration first: “Let’s explore before deciding.”  
2. **Set Boundaries** – Pause evaluation; focus on generating and building on ideas.  
3. **Open with Curiosity** – Ask expansive, open-ended questions.  
4. **Hold the Space** – Redirect judgment back to exploration when it arises.  
5. **Close Gently** – Summarize themes; leave decision for later phase.  

**Watch For:**  
- Premature closure or problem-solving.  
- Dominating voices shutting down contributions.  

**Remember:**  
The value is in what emerges before judgment, not just in what gets chosen.
