# 🧭 Practitioner Stability Suite

This directory contains the **three entry-level protocols** that form the practitioner’s on-ramp into the Proof-of-Thought Method (PoTM) framework.  
They are designed to be used **in sequence**, each one building on the clarity produced by the previous.

---

## 1️⃣ Filter Alignment Check — “Should I Practice?”

📄 [`filter_alignment_check.md`](./filter_alignment_check.md)

Before doing anything else, assess whether the framework’s **asymmetric costs** align with your **core filter** — what you actually optimize for when things get hard.  
This check prevents wasted effort and resentment by surfacing whether your motivation (OUTCOME, TRUTH, EFFICIENCY, etc.) matches what the framework rewards.

**Use this if:**
- You’re unsure whether PoTM practice will serve your objectives  
- You feel tension between fairness/authenticity and effectiveness  
- You’ve noticed resentment in prior frameworks or group work  

**Outcome:** A clear decision — *proceed, stop, or pilot-test.*

---

## 2️⃣ Structural Stability Self-Check — “What Skill Needs Attention?”

📄 [`structural_stability_self_check.md`](./structural_stability_self_check.md)

A **five-minute reflective checklist** that diagnoses which collaboration capacity needs reinforcement *right now.*  
It translates abstract lens theory into embodied practice — noticing where you lose stability, not where others do.

**Use this if:**
- You’ve chosen to practice and want to locate your weak point  
- You feel disoriented or reactive in difficult conversations  
- You want a quick daily or weekly diagnostic

**Outcome:** Identification of your current training ground (capacity honesty, intent clarity, MIRROR, CHECK, CONTRARY, dignity preservation, etc.).

---

## 3️⃣ Practitioner Quick-Start — “How Do I Begin Practicing?”

📄 [`practitioner_quick_start.md`](./practitioner_quick_start.md)

A **10-minute onboarding guide** that moves you from theory to embodiment.  
It helps you find your **blind-spot lens**, design a one-week micro-practice, and track social feedback loops.  
This is where the real learning begins.

**Use this if:**
- You understand the framework conceptually but don’t know what to practice  
- You want a concrete daily/weekly structure  
- You’re ready to integrate practice into live conversation contexts

**Outcome:** A one-week experiment in capacity building, with optional long-term integration.

## 📚 How They Fit Together

| Stage | Document | Purpose | Duration |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **1. Alignment** | [Filter Alignment Check](./filter_alignment_check.md) | Determine if the framework fits your core objectives | ~10 min |
| **2. Diagnosis** | [Structural Stability Self-Check](./structural_stability_self_check.md) | Identify which skill or lens to build first | ~5 min |
| **3. Practice** | [Practitioner Quick-Start](./practitioner_quick_start.md) | Begin structured daily or weekly practice | 1–4 weeks |

The three tools form a **lightweight self-assessment suite** usable without supervision.  
They support either a **strategic** (outcome-focused) or **transcendent** (practice-as-service) approach.

---

## 🧩 Practitioner Notes

- Run **Filter Alignment** before every new practice phase; your filter can shift over time.  
- Use **Structural Stability Self-Check** weekly as part of reflection or debrief.  
- Treat **Quick-Start** as the base layer for any extended PoTM program or communal dojo.  
- These documents are self-contained; no prior PoTM familiarity required.

## Lineage

Originated from the 2025 Framework Stack synthesis and refined through practitioner field tests (July–October 2025).  
Together they instantiate the *foundation layer* of the PoTM practice ecosystem — bridging conceptual literacy and embodied capacity.
