# 🧭 Structural Stability Self-Check

**What this is:**
A quick way to figure out which collaboration skill you need to work on right now.
Not a diagnosis—just a mirror to see where you're getting stuck.

**Why it matters:**
Sometimes conversations feel hard, but we don't know *why*.
This helps you identify the specific thing that needs attention.

## ✅ Seven Quick Questions

Read each one. Notice which feels most true right now.

---

### 1. Do you know when you're running out of energy?

**If yes:** You can sense your limits before hitting them.
**If no:** **Start here: Capacity Honesty** — practice noticing “I'm at 70%” before you crash.

---

### 2. Do you know what you're trying to accomplish in tough conversations?

**If yes:** You can name your goal clearly (“I want to understand” vs. “I want them to agree”).
**If no:** **Start here: Intent Clarity** — before responding, ask yourself “What am I actually trying to do?”

---

### 3. Can you stay calm when someone challenges you?

**If yes:** You can hear disagreement without getting defensive.
**If no:** **Start here: Dignity Preservation (Self)** — practice pausing before reacting when you feel attacked.

---

### 4. Can you repeat back what someone said before responding?

**If yes:** You naturally check understanding before replying.
**If no:** **Start here: MIRROR** — try “So you're saying [X]?” before giving your view.

---

### 5. Do you catch yourself making assumptions?

**If yes:** You notice when you're filling in gaps and check them.
**If no:** **Start here: CHECK** — when something feels confusing, say “I'm assuming [X], is that right?”

---

### 6. Can you disagree without making it personal?

**If yes:** You can say “I see it differently” without tension escalating.
**If no:** **Start here: CONTRARY** — practice “I understand your view, *and* here's mine…”

---

### 7. Can you tell when someone else is getting overwhelmed?

**If yes:** You notice subtle signals of exhaustion or frustration in others.
**If no:** **Start here: Dignity Sensitivity (Other)** — watch for shorter answers, withdrawn posture, longer pauses.

---

## 🎯 What to Do Next

Pick the **first “no”** you noticed. That’s your starting point.

**This week:**

1. **Notice** when this skill would have helped (just observe, don’t judge)
2. **Try it once** in a low-stakes conversation (with a friend, AI, or even yourself)
3. **Check:** Did it help? What happened?

That’s it. One skill. One week. See what changes.

## 💭 Extra Thoughts

* You don’t have to fix everything at once
* “No” answers aren’t failures—they’re starting points
* Skills build on each other (if you can’t do #1-3, start there before 4-7)
* Some days are harder than others—that’s normal

---

**Remember:**
These aren’t rules you follow.
They’re tools you use when conversations get hard.

**Lineage:**
Adapted from Claude’s *Framework Stack* synthesis (2025-10), reframed as a practitioner-first diagnostic.
Integrates the Foundation + Mechanical layers of the skill taxonomy into a one-page actionable self-check.
