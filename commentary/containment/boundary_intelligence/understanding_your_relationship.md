# Understanding Your Relationships: A Guide to Knowing Who Gets What

Have you ever felt confused about a relationship? Maybe someone expects more from you than you want to give, or you're not sure how close you should be to someone. Maybe you feel guilty for not being "closer" to a family member, or uncomfortable that a coworker knows so much about your problems.

This guide helps you understand that **not all relationships work the same way**. Once you see the different types, you can figure out what's right for each person in your life—and stop feeling guilty about it.

## The Big Idea: Two Questions, Not One

Most people think relationships are simple: either someone is "close" to you or they're not. But it's actually more complicated than that. There are really **two separate questions**:

**Question 1: How much do I share with this person?** (We call this *vulnerability*)
- Do they know my fears, my struggles, my secrets?
- Can I be honest about when I'm hurting or confused?
- Do I let them see the "real me" or just the polite version?

**Question 2: How much of my life do they take up?** (We call this *scope*)
- How much time do I spend with them?
- How many different parts of my life do they touch?
- What do we owe each other beyond our main connection?

Here's the surprising part: **these two questions don't always have the same answer.** You can share deep things with someone without owing them your whole life. You can have someone in your life a lot without telling them your secrets.

Understanding this can free you from a lot of guilt and confusion.

## The Five Types of Relationships

When you combine these two questions—how much you share and how much of your life someone takes up—you get five different types of relationships. Each type needs different boundaries.

### Type 1: Inner Circle (Share A Lot + They're In Your Life A Lot)

**Who they are:** Your closest friends, your partner, maybe a sibling or parent you're really close to. Usually 3-5 people total.

**What it looks like:**
- They know your deepest fears and biggest dreams
- You talk to them about everything, not just one topic
- You show up for their hard times and they show up for yours
- You spend significant time together
- The relationship is balanced—you both give and receive

**The boundary work:**
- **Protect this circle carefully.** These relationships take the most energy, so you can only have a few.
- **Make sure it's mutual.** If you're always the one giving support and never receiving it, something's wrong.
- **Check in regularly.** Do these relationships still feel good? Do you leave conversations feeling energized or drained?

**Example:** Your best friend knows about your job stress, your relationship worries, your health concerns, and your family drama. You text regularly, help each other move, and celebrate birthdays together.

### Type 2: Specialists (Share A Lot + But Only About One Thing)

**Who they are:** A therapist, a work mentor, a doctor, a spiritual advisor, a coach, a teacher you trust.

**What it looks like:**
- You share deep, vulnerable things with them—but only about their specialty
- Your mentor knows about your career fears but not about your marriage
- Your therapist knows about your childhood trauma but you don't go to their birthday party
- The relationship has clear boundaries about what it's for
- You don't owe them social time or support with their problems

**The boundary work:**
- **Keep it in its lane.** A work mentor doesn't need to know about your health issues. A therapist doesn't need updates on your hobbies.
- **Don't feel guilty about the limits.** Just because someone knows deep things about you doesn't mean they should be invited to everything.
- **Appreciate what they give.** These relationships let you get help without draining your closest people.

**Example:** You tell your therapist about your anxiety and childhood issues. You're completely honest with her. But you don't text her about your day, you don't know much about her personal life, and you wouldn't expect her to help you move.

**Why this type is so useful:** Sometimes your best friend can't help you with a specific problem—they don't have the expertise, or it would burden them too much. Specialists let you get intense help in one area without making it anyone's whole job to take care of you.

### Type 3: Engagement (Share Some + They're Somewhat In Your Life)

**Who they are:** Regular friends, coworkers you like, extended family you enjoy, neighbors you're friendly with. Maybe 20-40 people.

**What it looks like:**
- You have real conversations, not just small talk
- You share some of what's going on in your life, but not everything
- You do activities together—lunch, a hobby, family gatherings
- The relationship feels good but it's not super deep
- You help each other out in reasonable ways

**The boundary work:**
- **Keep expectations realistic.** These people aren't your therapist or your best friend. Don't expect them to handle your deepest problems.
- **Enjoy what's there.** These relationships can be really satisfying without being intense.
- **It's okay to keep some things private.** You don't have to tell them everything just because you like them.

**Example:** Your coworker knows you're stressed about a project and frustrated with your boss. You grab lunch together and genuinely enjoy it. But you don't tell them about your marriage problems or call them on weekends.

### Type 4: Obligatory Presence (Don't Share Much + But They're In Your Life A Lot)

**Who they are:** Difficult family members you can't avoid, a toxic coworker, your partner's difficult relative, someone you have to deal with regularly but don't trust.

**What it looks like:**
- They're physically or socially present in your life a lot
- But you don't feel safe being honest or vulnerable with them
- You might have to see them at holidays, work every day with them, or deal with them because of someone else
- The relationship doesn't feel good, but you can't just walk away
- They might demand more closeness than you want to give

**The boundary work (this is the hardest type):**
- **Protect yourself.** Just because someone is family or in your life a lot doesn't mean they deserve your deep thoughts and feelings.
- **Surface-level is okay.** You can be polite without being real.
- **Set clear limits.** How long will you stay at the gathering? What topics are off-limits? What won't you do for them?
- **Stop feeling guilty.** The fact that someone is related to you or around a lot doesn't mean you owe them intimacy.

**Example:** Your mother-in-law is at every family gathering. She criticizes how you parent and always centers herself in conversations. You keep interactions short and polite. You don't tell her about your worries or hopes. You leave after two hours even if she's annoyed.

**This is often where people get most confused.** We're taught that family = close, or that if someone is around a lot, we should share a lot. But that's not true. **High presence doesn't require high vulnerability.** You can keep someone at arm's length even if you see them often.

### Type 5: Recognition (Don't Share Much + They're Not In Your Life Much)

**Who they are:** Acquaintances, people you see occasionally, your mail carrier, the cashier you chat with, old friends you barely see anymore.

**What it looks like:**
- Pleasant but surface-level
- Small talk, weather, basic politeness
- No real sharing of problems or personal stuff
- They don't take up much of your time or energy

**The boundary work:**
- **This is easy.** Just be kind and move on.
- **Don't feel bad about the distance.** Most people in the world stay in this category, and that's fine.

**Example:** You say hi to your neighbor when you see them, maybe chat about the weather or local news. You don't know their problems and they don't know yours.

## The Mistake Most People Make

**The mistake:** Thinking that if you share something deep with someone, they automatically become "close" in every way, and you owe them more time, more support, and more of your life.

**The truth:** Sharing deeply about ONE thing (like with a specialist) doesn't mean someone gets access to your WHOLE life. And having someone around a lot (like an obligatory family member) doesn't mean you have to share your heart with them.

**Example of the confusion:**
- You tell your mentor about your insecurities at work. Now you feel like you should invite them to your birthday party. (No—they're a specialist. It's okay to keep it professional.)
- Your difficult uncle is at every holiday. You feel guilty for not confiding in him like you do with your friends. (No—he's obligatory presence. You don't owe him your inner world just because he's always there.)

## A Simple Chart to Help You Sort People

Think of someone in your life. Ask these two questions:

**Do I share vulnerable, real things with them?**
- Yes, about everything → might be Inner Circle
- Yes, but only about one specific thing → probably a Specialist
- Sometimes, but not deep stuff → probably Engagement
- No, I keep it surface → probably Obligatory Presence or Recognition

**How much of my life do they take up?**
- A lot of time and many areas → might be Inner Circle or Obligatory Presence
- Some time in one specific context → probably Specialist or Engagement  
- Very little time → probably Recognition

Now you can place them in one of the five types. That tells you what kind of boundaries are appropriate.

## What This Means for Your Guilt

**If someone is a Specialist:**
- Stop feeling bad that you don't invite them to everything
- Stop thinking you need to know about their personal life
- The relationship can be deep AND boundaried

**If someone is Obligatory Presence:**
- Stop feeling bad that you don't share your feelings with them
- Stop thinking family/coworkers automatically deserve intimacy
- You can be polite without being close

**If someone is in your Inner Circle but it feels wrong:**
- Maybe they should be Engagement instead (you like them but don't want them so deep in your life)
- Maybe they're trying to be Inner Circle but only offering Obligatory Presence (demanding closeness without earning trust)

## Daily Check-In: Questions for Each Type

You can do a quick evening check-in to see if your boundaries are working:

**For Inner Circle people:**
- After spending time with them today, do I feel more myself or less?
- Is this relationship still mutual, or am I doing all the work?

**For Specialists:**
- Did I keep the conversation in the right lane, or did I try to make them a friend?
- Did I get what I need from this bounded relationship?

**For Engagement people:**
- Am I expecting too much from this person, or is it comfortable as-is?
- Did we have a good time without me feeling drained?

**For Obligatory Presence people:**
- Did I protect myself during this required interaction?
- What made me feel like I should share more than I wanted to?
- What's the minimum contact that lets me stay okay?

**For Recognition people:**
- Was I polite? Good. That's all you need.

## The Bottom Line

**You get to decide what type of relationship each person is.** It's not determined by:
- Whether they're family
- How long you've known them  
- Whether they think you're close
- How often you see them

**It's determined by:**
- Whether you feel safe being vulnerable with them
- Whether the relationship is healthy and mutual
- How much energy and time you have
- What role makes sense for this person

**The five types give you permission to:**
- Be deeply honest with your therapist without inviting her to dinner
- See your difficult uncle at holidays without telling him your problems
- Keep your work mentor relationship about work
- Save your full self for the few people who truly know and love you

You don't owe everyone the same thing. Different relationships need different boundaries. And that's not selfish—it's smart.
