## The Boundary Intelligence System: A Triadic Model for Relational Health

The system is organized into three distinct layers, each addressing a different temporal need for boundary work:

| Layer | Document | Function | Cadence & Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Foundational Doctrine** | [`boundaries_guide.md`](./boundaries_guide.md) | Establishes the *What* and *Why* of boundaries; provides basic scripts and rules. | **Contextual:** Read once, revisit when limits are unclear or changing. |
| **II. Daily Calibration** | [`boundary_check_in.md`](../practices/boundary_check_in.md) | Provides the **iterative practice** (Examen/AAR) for energy tracking (**consolation/desolation**) and micro-adjustment. | **Daily:** 5-10 minute scan of energy and boundary effectiveness. |
| **III. Relational Audit** | [`relationship_checklist.md`](./relationship_checklist.md) | Provides **diagnostic criteria** for evaluating the overall health and sustainability of a specific relationship. | **Situational/Weekly:** A deeper health check when a relationship feels uncertain or chronically taxing. |

## I. Foundational Doctrine (The Grammar of Limits)

The `boundaries_guide.md` establishes the **conceptual grammar** for the entire system:

* **Definition:** Boundaries are "lines that protect your time, energy, and well-being," not walls to punish others.
* **Cues:** It trains the user to recognize the emotional cues for needed boundaries (resentment, overwhelm, obligation) and cues for overly rigid boundaries (avoiding intimacy, cutting people off quickly).
* **Protocol:** It provides the four essential steps for implementation: **Get Clear** $\to$ **Decide** $\to$ **Communicate Simply** $\to$ **Follow Through**.

This document is the **initial map** that provides the language and justification necessary to begin the practical work.

## II. Daily Calibration (The Iterative Engine)

The **Boundary Check-In** provides the **engine for continuous improvement**, directly integrating the iterative learning you identified:

* **Emotional Data:** It uses **Consolation** (feeling alive/supported) and **Desolation** (feeling drained/fragmented) as objective, non-moral data points to assess boundary success.
* **Pattern Interruption:** By asking "What fear or guilt drove my behavior?" (Step 4), it forces the user to identify the **internal script** that caused the boundary to fail, moving the work beyond just external behavior management.
* **The Matrix Application:** It applies the **Vulnerability/Scope Matrix** (Inner Circle, Specialist, Obligatory Presence, etc.) to ensure that the user asks the correct diagnostic question for the type of relationship they are reviewing (e.g., *Is my Inner Circle reciprocal?* vs. *Did I stay safe during my Obligatory Presence interaction?*).

This daily practice transforms boundary work from reactive struggle into **proactive, data-driven self-correction.**

## III. Relational Audit (The Health Diagnostic)

The `relationship_checklist.md` serves as a **macro-diagnostic tool** to assess the long-term sustainability of a relationship when daily adjustments aren't enough:

* **Focus on Core Health:** The seven questions (e.g., *Can you say “no” without getting in trouble?*) and warning signs move the focus from a single interaction (the Check-In) to the **structural integrity** of the entire relationship.
* **Decision Filter:** It helps the user determine if a relationship warrants continued effort and calibration (Inner/Engagement) or if it requires a sustained strategy of **containment or withdrawal** (Obligatory Presence/Stepping Back).
* **Aligns with Principles:** The questions (e.g., mutual respect, admission of mistakes, feeling seen) reinforce the core value alignment necessary for all healthy relationships, allowing the user to judge if the relationship meets the minimum requirements for the energy they are spending.

Together, these three components form a complete **Boundary Intelligence System** that provides the user with the doctrine, the daily practice, and the periodic review mechanism necessary to build and maintain healthy, sustainable relational boundaries.
