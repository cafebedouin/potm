# The Boundary Check-In

*A Daily Practice for Protecting Your Energy*

Some people leave you lighter, others leave you drained. This guide teaches a simple daily reflection practice—adapted from St. Ignatius’ *Examen*—to help you recognize which relationships sustain you and which require boundary adjustment. It pairs daily emotional discernment with a structural map of relationship types so that your energy use becomes conscious and recoverable.

## I. What Is a Boundary Check-In?

A **boundary check-in** is a 5–10-minute daily practice, usually in the evening, to notice how your interactions affected you. The goal is not perfection but **awareness through iteration**—adjusting boundaries the way you adjust a thermostat. It’s emotional hygiene for relational ecosystems.

Boundaries are not moral walls; they are **resource management systems**. This practice helps you conserve energy, prevent resentment, and refine your social structure through data gathered from lived experience.

---

## II. Why Daily Practice Matters

Boundaries drift. Life changes, moods shift, other people adapt or resist. A daily check-in detects those shifts early—before depletion or explosion. It transforms boundary work from reactive repair into preventive maintenance.

---

## III. The Five-Step Check-In

### 1. Notice What Gave You Energy

Write 1–3 moments that left you feeling alive or supported. Begin with the good to anchor gratitude and realism.

### 2. Ask for Clear Seeing

Pause. Three breaths. Say: *“Help me see today clearly, without being too hard on myself.”*
This separates observation from judgment.

### 3. Review Your Day

For each significant interaction, ask:

* **Did this leave me more alive?** (consolation)
* **Did this leave me less alive?** (desolation)

Note especially where you applied—or avoided—boundaries. Write down one or two key interactions.

### 4. Notice the Pattern Without Judging

Ask:

* What was I trying to protect?
* What fear or guilt drove my behavior?
* What pattern repeats?

Celebrate the effective moves as much as you note the leaks.

### 5. Choose One Small Change for Tomorrow

Examples:

* “Set a timer before visiting Mom.”
* “End the call at 15 minutes.”
* “Take three breaths before replying.”

Avoid vague goals (“be better at boundaries”). Commit to one experiment you can test tomorrow.

## IV. Relationship Typology: The Boundary Matrix

Boundary calibration depends on relationship **type**, not just intensity.
Relationships vary along two axes:

| Axis                         | Question                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerability / Intimacy** | How much of yourself do you share?                                         |
| **Scope / Reciprocity**      | How much of their life do you engage with, and what do you owe each other? |

### 1. Inner Circle — *High Vulnerability, High Scope*

Your closest 3-5 people.
**Practice:** Protect time, ensure reciprocity, deepen trust.

### 2. Specialists — *High Vulnerability, Low Scope*

Mentors, therapists, spiritual guides, coaches.
You share deeply within a defined domain; reciprocity is bounded by function.
**Practice:**

* Define the scope of vulnerability (“I talk career, not personal life”).
* Don’t expand social obligations beyond the contract.
* Recognize that using specialists is energy-optimizing—it protects your Inner Circle.

### 3. Engagement Group — *Medium Vulnerability, Medium Scope*

Close friends, supportive coworkers, extended family you enjoy.
**Practice:** Maintain balanced exchange; right-size expectations.

### 4. Obligatory Presence — *Low Vulnerability, High Scope*

Embedded but taxing ties (e.g., difficult relatives, unavoidable colleagues).
**Practice:** Contain. Limit time and disclosure; prioritize safety over politeness.
**Diagnostic cue:** guilt that you’re not “doing enough” signals scope confusion.

### 5. Recognition — *Low Vulnerability, Low Scope*

Acquaintances and service interactions.
**Practice:** Offer dignity without emotional labor.

## V. The Iterative Loop: Examen × Tier

| Examen Phase   | Boundary Focus            | Example Question                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Review**     | Assess energy outcome     | “After seeing Dad, did I feel clear or drained?”       |
| **Response**   | Identify internal scripts | “What guilt or fear made me overstay?”                 |
| **Resolution** | Set one small experiment  | “Tomorrow I’ll change the subject after one critique.” |

Use different metrics per category:

* **Inner Circle:** Reciprocity and nourishment
* **Specialists:** Scope drift (are we keeping it professional?)
* **Obligatory Presence:** Integrity protection (did I stay safe?)
* **Engagement:** Right-sized sharing
* **Recognition:** Civility without leakage

## VI. Template for Practice

```
Date: ___________

What gave me energy today:
1.
2.
3.

Interaction that left me MORE alive:
Interaction that left me LESS alive:
Pattern I notice:
One small change for tomorrow:

Next evening:
Did my small change work? What did I learn?
```

Five minutes a day. The gains compound.

---

## VII. Long-Term Outcomes

* Detect depletion earlier
* Trust your energetic data
* Replace guilt with discernment
* Strengthen resilient reciprocity in the Inner Circle
* Accept containment where repair is impossible

The point is not perfect boundaries. It’s **iterative clarity**—knowing what sustains you, acting on it, and forgiving yourself for learning slowly.

---

**Lineage:**
Forged from Claude’s *Boundary Check-In* and Gemini’s *Tiered Boundary Matrix*, expanded through practitioner synthesis introducing the *Specialist* and *Obligatory Presence* categories for multi-axis relational discernment.
