# A Daily Practice for Protecting Your Energy: The Boundary Check-In

Have you ever noticed that some people leave you feeling lighter after spending time with them, while others leave you feeling drained? Or maybe you've set a boundary with someone—like limiting how long you visit or what topics you'll discuss—but you're not sure if it's actually working?

This guide offers a simple daily practice to help you figure out what's working in your relationships and what needs to change. It's not about getting everything perfect. It's about paying attention to how you feel and making small adjustments over time.

## What Is a Boundary Check-In?

A boundary check-in is a short time each day (5-10 minutes, usually in the evening) when you reflect on your interactions and notice how they affected you. Think of it like checking the weather forecast before you get dressed—you're gathering information to help you make good choices.

This practice comes from an old tradition called the Examen, created hundreds of years ago by a teacher named St. Ignatius. He taught people to review their day not to judge themselves harshly, but to learn and grow. We've adapted it specifically for people who are working on protecting their energy and setting healthy boundaries.

## Why Daily Practice Matters

You might wonder: "Can't I just set a boundary once and be done with it?"

Here's the thing—boundaries aren't like rules you carve in stone. They're more like adjusting the thermostat in your house. Sometimes you need more warmth (more connection), sometimes you need more space (more distance). The right setting changes based on:

- How you're feeling that day
- What's happening in your life
- Whether the other person's behavior is improving or getting worse
- Whether your current boundaries are actually protecting you

A daily check-in helps you notice these shifts before you're completely exhausted or before resentment builds up.

## The Five-Step Check-In

### Step 1: Notice What Gave You Energy (2 minutes)

Start by thinking about moments from your day that felt good. This might include:
- A conversation that left you feeling understood
- Time spent doing something you enjoy
- A person who made you laugh or feel supported
- A moment when you felt proud of yourself

**Write down 1-3 things.** They can be small. "My friend texted to check on me" counts. "I took a walk at lunch" counts.

**Why this matters:** Starting with the good stuff prevents this practice from becoming a list of everything you did wrong. You need to remember that good things exist, especially when you're dealing with difficult relationships.

### Step 2: Ask for Clear Seeing (1 minute)

This step is about creating a little mental space before you look at the hard stuff. You might:
- Take three slow breaths
- Say to yourself: "Help me see today clearly, without being too hard on myself"
- Close your eyes for a moment and let your mind settle

**Why this matters:** When we review our day, we often judge ourselves harshly ("I should have said no!") or make excuses ("It wasn't that bad"). This step helps you be honest but kind with yourself.

### Step 3: Review Your Day with Two Questions (4-5 minutes)

Now think through your day, paying special attention to your interactions with other people. For each significant interaction, ask yourself two questions:

**Question 1: Did this leave me feeling MORE alive?**
Signs you felt more alive (we call this "consolation"):
- You felt energized, even if the conversation was challenging
- You felt clear and grounded
- You felt respected
- You felt like yourself
- You felt peaceful or content afterward

**Question 2: Did this leave me feeling LESS alive?**
Signs you felt less alive (we call this "desolation"):
- You felt drained or exhausted
- You felt confused or off-balance
- You felt guilty, ashamed, or not good enough
- You felt like you couldn't be honest
- You felt anxious or upset afterward

**Pay special attention to interactions where you had a boundary or needed one.** For example:
- Did you limit your time with someone? How did that feel afterward?
- Did you stay longer than you wanted? How did that feel?
- Did you avoid a topic you don't want to discuss? Did that work?
- Did you let someone guilt you into something? What happened after?

**Write down 1-2 interactions that stand out,** noting whether they left you feeling more or less alive.

### Step 4: Notice the Pattern Without Judging (1-2 minutes)

Look at what you wrote down. What do you notice?

If something left you feeling less alive, ask yourself:
- What was I trying to protect by doing what I did?
- What fear or guilty feeling came up?
- What pattern keeps repeating?

**Important:** This is not about beating yourself up. Maybe you stayed at dinner longer than you wanted because you were trying to avoid seeming rude. That makes sense! You were trying to protect yourself from being judged. The question is: did it work? Or did it just drain you?

If something left you feeling more alive, celebrate that! Notice what you did that worked.

### Step 5: Choose One Small Change for Tomorrow (1-2 minutes)

Based on what you learned today, what's ONE small thing you could try tomorrow?

Good small changes:
- "Before I visit Mom, I'll set a timer on my phone for one hour"
- "If my coworker starts complaining again, I'll say 'I need to focus on work' and put my headphones on"
- "When I notice the guilty feeling coming up, I'll take three breaths before I respond"
- "I'll text my friend who makes me feel good, even if it's just a quick hello"

Bad small changes (too big, too vague):
- ~~"I'll stop caring what people think"~~
- ~~"I'll be better at boundaries"~~
- ~~"I'll fix my relationship with my sister"~~

**Write down your one small change.** Tomorrow evening, you'll check whether it worked.

## What This Looks Like in Real Life

**Example 1: Maria and Her Demanding Friend**

**Step 1 (Energy):** "My daughter's hug when I got home. The walk I took at lunch."

**Step 3 (Review):** "My friend called and talked for 45 minutes about her problems. I felt drained and irritable after. I wanted to end the call after 15 minutes but I felt guilty."

**Step 4 (Pattern):** "I keep thinking I'm being a bad friend if I don't listen as long as she wants. I'm trying to protect myself from her thinking I'm selfish."

**Step 5 (Small change):** "Tomorrow if she calls, I'll say at the start: 'I have 15 minutes to chat.' Then I'll actually end the call at 15 minutes, even if it feels awkward."

**The next evening, Maria checks:** The boundary worked! She still felt a little guilty when she said she had to go, but afterward she felt proud of herself and had energy for her family. She'll try the same thing again.

**Example 2: James and His Critical Father**

**Step 1 (Energy):** "The project I finished at work. Joking around with my coworker."

**Step 3 (Review):** "Dad called and within two minutes was criticizing how I'm raising my kids. I tried to explain my reasons and got defensive. Felt awful for two hours after."

**Step 4 (Pattern):** "I keep trying to get him to understand my choices. I want his approval. But explaining just gives him more to criticize."

**Step 5 (Small change):** "Tomorrow if he criticizes my parenting, I'll say 'I've got it handled, Dad' and change the subject to something neutral like the weather."

**The next evening, James checks:** It half-worked. He changed the subject but then felt guilty about shutting his dad down. He realizes he needs to work on believing "I don't need his approval" more deeply. He'll keep practicing the redirect and also talk to his therapist about the approval-seeking pattern.

## Common Questions

**"What if I forget to do this every day?"**
That's okay. Do it when you remember. Even doing it once a week will help you learn about your patterns.

**"What if I realize I messed up and feel terrible about it?"**
The point isn't to feel terrible—it's to learn. Think of it like a scientist running experiments. Today's experiment didn't work. Tomorrow you'll try something slightly different.

**"What if my small change doesn't work?"**
Then tomorrow evening, you'll notice that and try a different small change. Maybe the boundary was too rigid, or not clear enough, or you need to try it in a different way. Keep adjusting until you find what works.

**"What if the other person gets mad at my boundary?"**
That's information too. Notice how you feel when they get mad. Do you feel guilty? Scared? Does their anger make you want to give in? Write that down in your check-in. Then ask: "Even though they're mad, do I feel more or less alive having set this boundary?" Often the answer is: "I feel uncomfortable but also relieved and more like myself."

**"What if nothing changes with the difficult person?"**
This practice isn't about changing other people—they might never change. It's about learning what level of contact works for you. Maybe you discover that 30-minute phone calls once a week feel okay, but two-hour visits leave you depleted. That's valuable information even if the other person never becomes easier to deal with.

## The Long Game

Think of this practice like building a muscle. At first, it might feel awkward or you might not notice much. But over time, you'll get better at:

- Recognizing the "drained" feeling earlier, before you're completely exhausted
- Trusting yourself when you need to set a limit
- Noticing guilt scripts without believing them automatically
- Finding the right-sized relationship with difficult people

The goal isn't to have perfect boundaries that never need adjusting. The goal is to keep learning what you need and keep protecting it, one small change at a time.

## A Simple Template to Copy

Here's a quick format you can copy into a notebook or phone:

---

**Date: _________**

**What gave me energy today:**
1.
2.
3.

**Interaction that left me feeling MORE alive:**

**Interaction that left me feeling LESS alive:**

**Pattern I notice:**

**One small change for tomorrow:**

---

**The Next Evening:**

**Did my small change work? What did I learn?**

---

That's it. Five to ten minutes a day. Over time, these small adjustments add up to big changes in how you feel and how you show up in your relationships.

You deserve to feel more alive than drained. This practice helps you protect that.
