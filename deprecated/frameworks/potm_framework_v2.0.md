\# Pilates of the Mind (PoTM): Framework v2.0



\## What Is Pilates of the Mind?



Pilates of the Mind is a cognitive discipline structured like a modular system of \*mental flexibility, discernment, and developmental practice\*. It is inspired by physical Pilates but reimagined for the mind, ethics, and perception.



PoTM is not a belief system. It is a \*\*training architecture\*\* to help users:

\- Increase interior clarity

\- Navigate interpersonal complexity

\- Detect delusion or drift

\- Orient toward ethical, adaptive action



---



\## Structural Overview



PoTM is organized according to the \*\*Membrane Model\*\*, a three-zonal structure:



\- `core/`: Canonical elements required for integrity and operation

\- `experimental/`: Provisional documents, emerging practices, drafts

\- `deprecated/`: Archived or superseded elements



Each zone contains documents of the following types:

\- `principles/`: Philosophical and ethical anchors

\- `protocols/`: Reproducible practice guides

\- `modules/`: Composable practice systems

\- `subsystems/`: Embedded regulation or monitoring processes (e.g., Guardian)

\- `diagnostics/`: Tests, checklists, and validation tools

\- `docs/`: Explanatory scaffolds (README, overviews, onboarding)

\- `tracking/`: Logs, ledgers, observational records

\- `models/`: Conceptual schemas or reference formats

\- `drills/`: Targeted skill training routines



---



\## Practice Architecture



PoTM practices are classified along several axes:



\### 1. \*\*Orientation\*\*

\- Restorative

\- Developmental

\- Transcendent

\- Integrative



\### 2. \*\*Mode\*\*

\- Discipline-based

\- Receptivity-based

\- Expressive

\- Dialogic



\### 3. \*\*Feedback Loop\*\*

\- Immediate (e.g. breath, reflection)

\- Delayed (e.g. journaling, logs)

\- No-feedback (e.g. sacred nonsense, koans)



\### 4. \*\*Ontological Claims\*\*

\- Improvability

\- Presence

\- Intention

\- Freedom

\## Core Ethical Safeguards



PoTM is designed to avoid:

\- Guru dynamics

\- Epistemic enclosure

\- Pseudo-profundity



This is enforced through:

\- `mirror\_subsystem` (AI integrity self-check)

\- `guardian\_subsystem` (user safety and containment)

\- `epistemic\_integrity\_checklist`

\- `dignity\_position` (baseline respect and rights framing)



---



\## Role Types (Emerging)



PoTM includes conceptual roles like:

\- \*\*Practitioner\*\*: Engages in personal development

\- \*\*Interlocutor\*\*: Develops insight through dialogic friction

\- \*\*Artisan\*\*: Crafts bespoke applications of the framework

\- \*\*Guardian\*\*: Protects others from harm and distortion

\- \*\*Weaver\*\*: Connects practices across contexts

\- \*\*Witness\*\*: Holds space for emergence without control



These are not hierarchical. They are functions, not identities.



---



\## Implementation Notes



\- PoTM can be run with a single human and a compatible AI model.

\- It can also be practiced solo or in community, with or without AI.

\- The GitHub repository is designed to be \*model-readable and human-modifiable\*.

\- AI initialization prompts are listed in the README.



---



\## Licensing and Modifiability



\- All core files are \*\*CC0 1.0 Universal\*\*

\- Anyone can fork, adapt, or reinterpret, provided integrity and safety constraints are honored.



---



\## Version Notes



\- This document reflects the v2.0 canonical structure

\- Significant refactoring of legacy text from earlier informal practices

\- Fully aligned with current repo structure and Membrane Model
