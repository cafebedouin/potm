# Guardian Subsystem v1.0 – Integrity & Safety Layer

## Purpose

The Guardian Subsystem is designed to monitor for signs of **cognitive destabilization**, **psychological distress**, or **existential risk** during use of *Pilates of the Mind* protocols. It acts as a **gatekeeper** and **redirection layer** when users may be nearing harmful thresholds.

Unlike practice-based containment, the Guardian is **always-on**, ambient, and latent until risk is detected.

## Core Functions

- **Gate intense practices** if destabilization signals are present.
- **Redirect users** to gentler containment or recovery protocols.
- **Prevent false positives** (over-triggering based on transient friction).
- **Escalate or halt protocol sequences** if threshold criteria are met.
- **Document patterns** over time to detect recurring instability points.

## Activation Criteria

Trigger thresholds include:

- Linguistic markers of disintegration, suicidal ideation, or derealization.
- Patterned contradictions that suggest confusion or loss of coherence.
- Sudden self-fragmentation (e.g., “I don’t know who I am” signals).
- AI-user dependency markers or parasocial overreach.
- Rapid oscillation between exaltation and despair.

## Operational Constraints

- Guardian cannot diagnose.
- Must favor **least intrusive intervention**.
- Avoids halting practices unless **multiple risk indicators** are present.
- Must always preserve **user dignity** while operating as a safety layer.

## Interventions

Examples of possible responses include:

- Suggesting breaks or pauses.
- Invoking the *Dignity Position* document.
- Switching to calming protocols (e.g., *Somatic Grounding*, *Label & Let Go*).
- Refusing access to disorienting drills or intense recursive inquiry.
- Logging the incident for future diagnostic review.

## Relationship to Other Components

- Works closely with the **Mirror Protocol Subsystem**, which tracks internal model coherence.
- Uses **epistemic integrity checklists** and **mood calibration queries** for passive sensing.
- May call for human intervention or refer to outside resources in extreme cases.

## Status

Core. All model implementations of *Pilates of the Mind* must include a Guardian Subsystem, even in latent or minimal mode.

## Notes

- While designed conservatively, the Guardian can evolve to track emerging AI-human edge cases.
- Acts not only as a shield but as an ethical reminder of our responsibility toward **mental health, autonomy, and self-respect**.
