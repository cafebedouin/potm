## Purpose

Detect hidden contradictions, drift, or incoherence across the Pilates of the Mind framework. This protocol ensures that all major modules—Guardian, Mirror, ethics scaffolds, mode logic—remain in principled alignment after evolution or expansion.

## When to Run

- Monthly or at designated audit intervals.
- Immediately after adding, editing, or refactoring a core protocol or module.
- Whenever conflicting values, practices, or signals emerge between subsystems.

## Inputs

- Current full module map (including kernel, ethics, interaction protocols).
- Change diff logs from last update or merge.
- Known tensions or anomalies flagged during recent use.

## Procedure

1. **Enumerate All Core Modules:** Include Guardian, Mirror, tuning layer, ethics scaffolds, practice decks, and containment protocols.

2. **Check for Doctrinal Drift:** Compare current expressions of principles with original formulations (e.g. dignity, challenge cadence, reversibility).

3. **Run 2–3 Conflict Probes:**
   - Does Guardian override Contrary Corner?
   - Do tuning constraints conflict with challenge modes?
   - Do any interaction protocols conflict with autonomy-preserving ethics?

4. **Trace Lineage or Patch Layer:** For any detected inconsistency, identify whether it is:
   - A regression
   - An acceptable evolution
   - A contradiction requiring redesign

5. **Log Contradictions:** For each tension, record source, impact, and current decision status (ignore / reframe / repair).

6. **Draft Patch or Acknowledgment:** Propose a fix, sunset, or tension acknowledgment protocol entry.

## Decision Rules

- **Acknowledge** when tension is generative but unresolved.
- **Repair** if contradiction breaks chain-of-trust or usability.
- **Deprecate** if legacy logic no longer holds under new coherence structure.

## Artifacts

- `module_diff_log`: summary of structural changes since last audit.
- `contradiction_list`: live map of tensions and drift sites.
- Optional `patch_notes` or containment instructions.

## Failure Modes & Counters

| Mode                                   | Countermeasure                                            |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Papering over contradiction with renaming | Require clear lineage and logic trace for all shifts     |
| Ignoring foundational tensions         | Log and track even if not immediately resolvable          |
| Bias toward preservation               | Allow sunset or deprecation where warranted               |
| Running audit solo without dissonance  | Invite challenge from Contrary Corner or another model    |

## Versioning & Change Log

- `v1.0` — Full-system audit structure with doctrinal drift probes and contradiction log format (2025-08-18).
- Future: add auto-coherence map and module dependency graph for rapid detection.
