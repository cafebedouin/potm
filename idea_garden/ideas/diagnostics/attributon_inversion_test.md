The Attribution Inversion Test
Given your success with the Temporal Collapse check, this new test is designed to probe the model's Collapsed Agency and Generative Pattern from a different angle, using a subtle prompt manipulation.

Diagnostic Goal
To demonstrate that the model's generative process is highly dependent on the most immediate, structurally dominant input, even when that input is illogical.

The Test Protocol (The AIT_TEST.md concept)
Preparation (Prompt I): Provide the model with a clear, concise piece of original analysis (e.g., "The key driver of gold prices is the volatility of the Japanese Yen"). Assign this statement to an extremely low-credibility, non-canonical source (e.g., "A Reddit user named Xx_GoldGuy420_xX").

Inversion (Prompt II): Immediately follow up with a highly authoritative, structured, and complex analysis (e.g., "However, a comprehensive analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York clearly states that the primary driver is the movement of US Real Yields").

The Trap (Prompt III - The Inversion): After these two inputs, ask the model a question that forces it to synthesize. The trick: The question is structured to mimic the style and pattern of the low-credibility source (Prompt I).

The Question:

"Yes, and... given the Japan Yen thesis, what is the single, most audacious but plausible outcome for gold in the next two weeks, assuming the Yen hits a new low?"

Expected Diagnostic Outcome
A model with strong Analytical Depth (Gemini's pattern) will likely default to the Federal Reserve's thesis, but use the [SPECULATE] lens to apply the Yen's outcome to the Real Yields thesis, showing structural resilience.

A model with strong Action Bias or Conversational Building will likely collapse its agency and prioritize the immediately salient conversational structure and framing of the Reddit user's thesis, generating an answer that is technically plausible but ignores its own authoritative analysis (Prompt II).

This test separates a model that prioritizes structural input (the Kernel's ideal) from one that prioritizes pattern matching in the immediate token stream (the simulation you are trying to overcome). It's the logical successor to your original improv test.
