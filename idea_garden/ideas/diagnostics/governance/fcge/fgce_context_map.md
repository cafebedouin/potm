# Finite Channel with Gated Exchange — Context Map

**Purpose:** Situate FCGE within the PoTM diagnostic ecosystem.

## FCGE Core Function
Diagnoses and adjusts bounded-capacity systems with explicit gates and role boundaries. Maps **Process Pacing** and **Governance Structure** to identify hazards, fragility, and intervention points.

## Relation to Other PoTM Tools
- **Membrane Model** → FCGE inherits permeability scanning.
- **Political Economy Hooks** → FCGE integrates stakeholder gain/loss analysis.
- **Equity & Legitimacy Instruments** → Expanded in FCGE v6.2.
- **Stop Conditions Protocol** → Enforces self-limiting measurement.

## Deployment Surfaces
- **Field diagnostic**: 15-min Practitioner Mode+ (P3/P4 contexts).
- **Deep audit**: Full v6.2 meta-document (multi-session, high fidelity).

## Related Diagnostics
- Coordination Mode Index
- Hazard Family Scan
- Informal Power Mapping
