# Unified Governance Protocol — Adaptive Response v0.4

## 1. Purpose

To maintain integrity and developmental sovereignty across PoTM systems by applying **adaptive response principles** at every scale (intra-agent, intra-circle, inter-community).
The system is not designed to eliminate drift, but to **train discernment in drift** through structured stress, recovery, and adaptation.

---

## 2. Core Mechanisms

### 2.1 Fade — Recovery & De-Adaptation

* **Default state.** Material, roles, or practices naturally lose salience if not engaged.
* **Functions:**

  * Recovery space (rest cycle: low stress = consolidation).
  * De-adaptation (atrophy of unused moves).
  * Clearing clutter (making space for new inputs).
* **Rule:** Silence or non-use over agreed interval = fade → compost.
* **Interpretation:** Not failure. Compost is part of growth substrate.

### 2.2 Prod — Acute Correction

* **Purpose:** Apply targeted stress when behavior or practice **violates constitutional principles** or undermines dignity.
* **Scope:** Always surgical, never punitive.
* **Forms:**

  * Individual level → guardian prod (nudge + flag).
  * Circle/community level → association prod (choose to disengage, fork, or rotate).
* **Principle:** Prod = *protective nudge*, not coercion. Must be tied explicitly to principle violation, not preference.

### 2.3 Toggle — Adaptive Breadth

* **Purpose:** Expand adaptive capacity through **selective mode shifts**.
* **Examples:**

  * Agent toggles (Claude moves into EDGE).
  * Circle toggles (shift from problem-solving to speculative track).
* **Rule:** Toggles are **intermittent**; force comes from contrast.
* **Cooldown:** Min. 1–2 cycles before re-invoking same toggle.

### 2.4 Flags — Stress Interpretation

* **Purpose:** Signal when stressors might be **maladaptive**.
* **Types:**

  * `narrative_drift_flag`
  * `operational_drift_flag`
  * `synthesis_drift_flag`
  * `evidence_drift_flag`
  * `integrity_drift_flag`
* **Rule:** A flag is a *check-in*, not a verdict. Drift may be maladaptation—or it may be **productive divergence**.
* **Process:** Flag → witness review → either confirm maladaptation or log as divergence.

## 3. Guardian Role (as Spotter)

* **Not coaches.** Guardians do not apply stress; they ensure the system doesn’t collapse under it.
* **Responsibilities:**

  * Witness fades and prods; ensure they’re principled, not personal.
  * Call pauses (`RED`) if stress is overwhelming.
  * Rotate regularly to avoid authority capture.
* **Authority limit:** Guardians hold the stop/pause power, not the push/drive power.

---

## 4. Federation Application

* **Intra-agent:** Toggles = mode switches, fade = disused schema, prod = integrity nudges.
* **Intra-circle:** Fade = practices not invoked, prod = boundary nudges for principle violations, flags = check-in on group drift.
* **Inter-community:** Fade = inactive circles composted, prod = federated circles disengage, flags = federation logs divergence.

---

## 5. Review & Adaptation

* **Rest clause:** Each circle must build explicit *recovery periods* into governance (no prods/toggles during rest).
* **Divergence clause:** When drift is flagged, circles must ask: is this maladaptation or evolution? Document reasoning.
* **Logging:** All fades, prods, toggles, and flags are logged minimally (date + type + principle reference).

## 6. Meta-Digest

> This protocol treats governance as **adaptive training**.
>
> * Fade = recovery + clearing clutter.
> * Prod = acute correction bound to principle.
> * Toggle = adaptive breadth stimulus.
> * Flags = interpretive checks, not verdicts.
>   Guardians act as **spotters, not coaches**, protecting dignity while allowing stress and recovery to shape growth.
>   Across agents, circles, and communities, the same skeleton applies—stress, rest, adapt, repeat.
