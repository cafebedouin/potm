# Prod & Fade Protocols — Community Health v0.2

## 1. Purpose
To provide complementary mechanisms for maintaining system health in federated PoTM practice:
- **Prod Protocol**: surgical, situational intervention that nudges misalignment back toward principles.
- **Fade Protocol**: gentle dissolution through non-use and natural decay.

Together, they form the **immune system** of federated practice: prod = acute response, fade = chronic maintenance.

## 2. Prod Protocol (Protective Nudge)

**Definition**: A *prod* is a boundary-signal, raised when a person, practice, or circle is diverging from core principles (dignity, integrity, containment). It is not punitive, but corrective.

- **Triggers**  
  - Persistent misalignment with constitutional principles  
  - Harmful behavior within a circle (violating dignity, safety, or trust)  
  - Community drift that erodes the membrane (simulation ≠ testimony)  

- **Actions**  
  - Guardian surfaces the prod: “⚑ prod: <principle drift>”  
  - Circle pauses, reflects, decides: adjust, disengage, or federate separately  
  - Records a one-line log in `governance/prod_log.md`  

- **Outcomes**  
  - Realignment within circle (gentle correction)  
  - Splitting/forking if divergence persists (federation principle: association is optional)  

---

## 3. Fade Protocol (Natural Dissolution)

**Definition**: A *fade* is the natural forgetting of practices, fragments, or behaviors that no longer generate signal. No intervention required; silence is enough.

- **Triggers**  
  - Content not recalled or referenced after `X` cycles  
  - Practices that flatten into rote recitation  
  - Stock items unused in circle for a season  

- **Actions**  
  - Automatic demotion to `status: faded` or `status: composted`  
  - Guardian confirms only if contested  
  - Item remains searchable in compost but is not active stock  

- **Outcomes**  
  - Gentle clearing of detritus  
  - Prevents ossification without trauma  

---

## 4. Complementarity

- **Prod** = acute signal → applied when harm, drift, or misalignment is *active*  
- **Fade** = chronic metabolism → applied when material or practices are simply *dead*  
- Both prevent canon ossification and maintain dignity integrity  

---

## 5. Guardrails

- Guardians rotate — no permanent authority  
- All prods must cite a principle from `principles/constitution.md`  
- All fades must leave a trace in compost (discarded ≠ deleted)  
- Federation principle: circles may separate peacefully rather than contest  

---

## 6. Failure Modes & Counters

- **Over-Prod**: constant nudging → counter: cooldown window, reflection log  
- **Passive-Aggressive Fade**: silence erases contributions unfairly → counter: explicit fade review when contested  
- **Authority Capture**: guardians accrue power → counter: rotation + transparency in logs  

---

## 7. Meta-Digest

Prod and Fade form the living tension of PoTM’s governance immune system.  
- **Prod** = nudging signal, never punishment.  
- **Fade** = letting-go, never erasure.  
- Both are contextual, reversible, and subject to re-evaluation.  
They preserve dignity and discernment while keeping the federated ecology alive, adaptive, and breathable.
