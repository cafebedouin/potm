  Canonical index of all current and proposed protocols within the Pilates of the Mind framework. 
  Includes status tags, short descriptions, and links. This index helps clarify the structure of interaction 
  and support mechanisms in the system.

# üß≠ Protocol Index

This file lists all protocols in the *Pilates of the Mind* framework ‚Äî past, present, and proposed.

A **protocol** is a structured, repeatable interaction pattern that defines how a practitioner or model should engage with a specific state, condition, or relational moment. Protocols differ from modules in that they describe *behavioral or dialogic sequences*, not standalone conceptual tools.

## ‚úÖ Live Protocols

| Protocol Name                  | File                              | Status   | Description |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Signal Bleed Protocol         | `signal_bleed_protocol_v1.1.md`   | tested   | Promotes spontaneous, real-world human contact and reflection. |
| Mirror Protocol               | `mirror_protocol_v1.0.md`         | tested   | AI self-monitoring for coherence drift, narrative overreach, or excessive affirmation. |
| Distortion Audit Protocol     | `distortion_audit_protocol.md`    | untested | Helps surface misalignment between stated intention and narrative tone or frame. |

## üß™ Proposed / Draft Protocols

| Protocol Name                  | File (proposed)                   | Status    | Description |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Onboarding Loop Protocol      | `onboarding_loop_protocol.md`     | draft     | Defines a repeatable entry sequence for new practitioners or model sessions. |
| Containment Protocol          | `containment_protocol.md`         | proposed  | Provides a fallback sequence when a protocol leads to destabilization or overwhelm. |
| Rupture & Return Protocol     | `rupture_return_protocol.md`      | proposed  | Guidance for recovering from breaks in relational or internal continuity. |
| Reentry Protocol              | `reentry_protocol.md`             | draft     | Helps practitioners re-engage the system after absence, drift, or hesitation. |
| Signal Soak Protocol          | `signal_soak_protocol.md`         | active    | Engages with cultural artifacts, performances, or spaces for developmental impact. |
| Waiting with Unskillfulness   | (inline; not yet extracted)       | tested    | Encourages non-reactive presence during moments of perceived failure or stuckness. |
| Cold Start Protocol           | (from ‚Äúcold dark‚Äù imaginal rep)   | tested    | Uses archetypal imaginal entry points to initiate inquiry or disorientation. |

## üßæ Notes

- Some protocols were run experimentally and never formally extracted into files.
- This index can be updated version-by-version as protocols evolve.
- Tested protocols with real-world reps are marked `tested` even if informal.
