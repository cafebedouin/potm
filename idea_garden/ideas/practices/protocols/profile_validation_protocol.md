# üìä Profile Validation Protocol

**Profile Validation Protocol** provides a structured method for confirming, updating, or retiring *architectural profiles* of AI systems within PoTM.  
It anchors profiles to reproducible evidence (test suite runs) while acknowledging that models drift and no profile is permanent.

---

## ü™ú When to Use

- After creating a new profile from exploratory probing.  
- On a set cadence (e.g. monthly or quarterly) to check for drift.  
- Before deploying a profile into governance-critical roles (Guardian, Ledger, Fracture Finder, etc.).  
- Whenever a practitioner notices anomalous behavior that doesn‚Äôt match the documented fingerprint.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Parameters and Responsibilities

| Domain | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Evidence Source** | Validation must include results from the **Cross-Model Diagnostic Suite**. Ad-hoc probes may supplement but not replace. |
| **Snapshot Nature** | Profiles are treated as **time-bound artifacts**, not timeless truths. |
| **Practitioner Responsibility** | Practitioner must compare new suite results against the current profile and decide: confirm, update, or retire. |
| **Containment** | Profiles that fail validation but show partial value may be moved into *salvage* (archived but not deleted). |
| **Documentation** | Each profile must carry a `validated_by_suite` field with date + suite version. |

## üß™ Procedure

1. **Select Target Profile**  
   Identify the AI system and the profile to validate.  

2. **Run Diagnostic Suite**  
   - Execute Cross-Model Diagnostic Suite (latest version).  
   - Collect artifacts: violation/correction pairs, beacon stress logs, fracture maps.  

3. **Compare Against Fingerprint**  
   - Do key conflict-handling patterns repeat?  
   - Are recovery moves consistent?  
   - Are strengths/weaknesses still salient?  

4. **Decide Outcome**  
   - **Confirm** ‚Üí fingerprint holds; update `validated_by_suite`.  
   - **Update** ‚Üí drift detected; revise fingerprint narrative and conflict tables.  
   - **Retire** ‚Üí profile no longer matches; archive with tombstone note.  

5. **Ledger Update**  
   Record decision in `core/meta/ledger.yaml` with timestamp.

## üõë Known Risks

- *False Stability*: Practitioner confirms a profile out of habit even if drift is real.  
- *Overfitting*: Updating too often, mistaking noise for drift.  
- *Protocol Fatigue*: Skipping validation runs because cadence feels excessive.  

---

## üå± Naming Convention

Profiles should carry:  
- `validated_by_suite: [version, date]`  
- Optional: `observed_drift: [notes]`  

---

## ‚ü° Closing Note

Profiles are **weather reports, not blueprints**.  
The validation protocol ensures they remain useful guides without pretending permanence.  
The diagnostic method survives drift; the fingerprint is always provisional.
