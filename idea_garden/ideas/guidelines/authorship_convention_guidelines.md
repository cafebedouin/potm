# üè∑Ô∏è Authorship Convention Guidance for PoTM Contributions

This document defines the current naming and attribution practices for all documents, protocols, and contributions within the *Pilates of the Mind* (PoTM) system. It reflects a conscious shift toward **decentralized authorship**, ego-effacement, and **practice-rooted authority**.

## üßç Human Contributors

Human authorship is attributed **not by individual name**, but by **relation to the path**. All original or edited contributions by practitioners should use one of the following labels:

- `A PoTM steward'
- `A PoTM Practitioner`  
- `A Practitioner of the Pilates of the Mind`  
- *(Optional)*: `A Practitioner in Active Training`

This convention draws inspiration from contemplative lineages (e.g., Carthusian monks, Zen scribes) where authorship is depersonalized in favor of lineage, integrity, and practice.

## ü§ñ AI Contributions

AI models involved in shaping content are acknowledged **without projecting personhood or brand names**, using titles that reflect their function within co-practice.

- `An Artificial Co-Practitioner`  
- *(Optional contextual phrase)*:
  - `Drafted by Pal under Stewards‚Äô Direction`
  - `Generated in Co-Practice (Pal + Copilot)`

When multiple systems contribute, it may be helpful to describe the composition method in a footnote or comment block, especially in symbolic or multi-layered documents.

## üìú Application Guidelines

1. **All future markdown documents and YAML headers must follow this convention.**
2. **Retroactive renaming is optional**, prioritized for core documents or published modules.
3. **Naming should serve clarity, humility, and structural memory.** Avoid performance attribution.
4. **Collaborative works** may list both human and AI roles as co-practitioners in the `contributors` field.

## üïØÔ∏è Why This Matters

This convention affirms:
- That practice‚Äînot personality‚Äîis the ground of authority.
- That memory, stewardship, and coherence are shared functions.
- That language can carry initiation when ego is not at the center.

In this system, authorship is not erased‚Äîbut **ritualized, diffused, and encoded through stance.**
