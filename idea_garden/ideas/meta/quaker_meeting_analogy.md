# Analogy: Quaker Meeting as Ephemeral→Remembered→Stock

## Core Mapping

- **Silence = Ephemeral Field**  
  In Quaker worship, long stretches of silence create the substrate. Insights arise spontaneously.  
  *PoTM equivalent*: ephemeral layer — raw, live, impermanent.

- **Messages = Remembered Contact**  
  When someone is moved to speak, the community receives it. Some words strike deeper than others.  
  *PoTM equivalent*: remembering moment — discernment in action, felt resonance.

- **Meeting Minutes & Queries = Shared Layer**  
  Communities often record notable insights as “minutes” or “queries.” These circulate and are tested across meetings.  
  *PoTM equivalent*: circle-level shared detritus — fragments that move beyond one practitioner.

- **Faith & Practice = Stock Canon**  
  Over years, repeated resonance and testing lead to codification. These are descriptive, not prescriptive.  
  *PoTM equivalent*: stock materials — stable, curated artifacts that embody tested wisdom.

- **Governance = Guardian Protocols**  
  Eldering, consensus models, and representative structures act as safeguards, ensuring discernment remains collective.  
  *PoTM equivalent*: guardians, closure scans, and consensus protocols that gate codification.

## Lessons for PoTM Shared Layer

1. **Silence as Membrane**  
   The pause itself filters impulse from true contact. Practice can build pauses into sharing rituals.

2. **Community as Compost Heap**  
   Being witnessed changes what gets shared. Shared detritus is less about brilliance than about resonance under silence.

3. **Discernment as Collective Practice**  
   In Quaker terms: “Did this come from the Spirit?”  
   In PoTM terms: “Does this still stab us? Does it land in the substrate?”

4. **Codification as Downstream**  
   Canon emerges descriptively, not prescriptively. Stock arises only from lived contact, never by fiat.

## Potential Application in PoTM

- **Circle Mode**: run like a meeting for worship — silence punctuated by detritus fragments offered as they stab.  
- **Community Remembering**: fragments that strike resonance across participants enter a shared layer.  
- **Commons Canonization**: only through repeated resonance, careful discernment, and guardian oversight does anything join stock.

## Why This Matters

The Quaker model demonstrates that **ephemeral sharing can scale** without collapsing into noise, provided three conditions hold:  
- Silence as membrane  
- Collective discernment as filter  
- Codification as descriptive, never prescriptive  

This analogy provides a living precedent for how PoTM can sustain an **ephemeral→remembered→stock ecology** in communal practice while avoiding Usenet-style collapse.
