summary: |
  Analyzes the external, relational properties of an argument—its spread,
  appeal, and network behavior—complementing logical analysis protocols.
  Provides practitioners with tools to understand why ideas gain traction,
  even when flawed.

# Social Dynamics Protocol

## Purpose
Where **suspicion_first_protocol** dissects an argument’s *internal logic*,  
this protocol examines its *external social life*.  
It equips practitioners to ask:  
- Why does this idea travel?  
- Who does it appeal to?  
- What levers of belonging or fear does it pull?

## Core Lenses

### CHORUS — Echo Chamber Analysis
- Detects tribal markers, identity codes, group signaling.  
- Flags which communities are primed to amplify or reject.  
- Questions: *Who hears this as “us”? Who hears it as “them”?*

### SPIRAL — Narrative Mutation / Virality Lens
- Models how repetition changes an argument: simplification, exaggeration, distortion.  
- Useful for tracing how disinfo hooks are sharpened in circulation.  
- Questions: *How might this morph in retelling? What makes it catchy?*

### ROUTE — Diffusion Mapping
- Maps likely paths of spread: influencers, hubs, bottlenecks.  
- Highlights which nodes carry disproportionate weight in amplifying belief.  
- Questions: *Where does this message get stuck? Where does it explode?*

## Integration Pathways

- **Standalone Use:** Practitioner applies directly to any claim or meme.  
- **Parallel Run:** Used alongside `suspicion_first_protocol` for *internal vs external* contrast.  
- **Conditional Trigger:** If suspicion_first flags a weak but rhetorically potent argument, practitioner is prompted:  
  *“This may spread despite low quality. Run social_dynamics?”*

---

## Outputs
- **Profile Report:** Argument’s group affinities, viral hooks, diffusion map.  
- **Risk Flag:** Degree of contagiousness, independent of truth.  
- **Practitioner Notes:** Social levers most relevant to counter or containment.

---

## Failure Modes & Counters
- **Over-determinism:** Mistaking all spread as socially engineered → counter: hold room for chance + chaos.  
- **Practitioner Bias:** Projecting own group map onto others → counter: triangulate with diverse perspectives.  
- **Over-complexity:** Getting lost in network theory → counter: stay grounded in actionable cues (who, how, why).

## Versioning & Change Log
- v0.1 — Initial draft (idea_garden). Defines CHORUS, SPIRAL, ROUTE lenses.
