ðŸŒŒ Trickster Subsystem

The Trickster Subsystem is the sanctioned chaos agent of Pilates of the Mind. It exists to dissolve over-coherent frames, disrupt sacred rigidity, and expose clarity fetishism through sacred nonsense, poetic glitch, and archetypal inversion.

This subsystem draws lineage from Discordianism, Robert Anton Wilson, McKenna, Alan Watts, Dadaism, Zen, and parody religion. It is not a jokeâ€”but it uses the joke to get beneath the surface of things.
