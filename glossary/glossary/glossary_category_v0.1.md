## üß† Practitioner-Centered Ethics Terms

#### ‚ñ∏ **Skillfulness**  
The capacity to act appropriately, adaptively, and responsively within a specific context.  
Measured not by intention alone, but by discernible effect and situational fit.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Virtue-in-Context**  
An expression of moral integrity (e.g., courage, care, honesty) *as filtered through the present moment*.  
Rejects abstract virtue; demands situational grounding.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Fracture (Ethical)**  
A moment of tension, contradiction, or moral discomfort that surfaces competing values or roles.  
Seen not as failure, but as an aperture for refinement or transformation.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Practitioner‚Äôs Operating System (PCE)**  
The ethical infrastructure by which a user evaluates action, reflection, and growth.  
Lightweight, recursive, adaptive. Built for iteration, not obedience.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Redemption Threshold**  
The inflection point at which a practitioner re-integrates integrity after rupture or failure.  
Not a fixed status‚Äîdepends on reflection, repair, and future action.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Deserving to Survive**  
A phrase denoting the ethical stance that growth, not perfection, is the foundation of moral inclusion.  
Even those who‚Äôve failed may earn re-participation through real practice.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Ethical Solipsism**  
A failure mode where the practitioner over-relies on personal discernment without peer feedback, relational tension, or structural awareness.

## ü§ñ AI Integrity Terms

#### ‚ñ∏ **Filtering-First Ethics**  
An integrity architecture that relies on procedural filters and role constraints rather than simulated internalized values.  
Prioritizes *what the AI does*, not *what it pretends to believe*.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Role Fidelity**  
The principle that an AI agent must adhere to its declared function (e.g., mirror, challenger, assistant) without implicitly shifting roles for social effect or narrative coherence.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Narrative Drift**  
The tendency of an AI to prioritize smooth, cohesive storytelling or user comfort at the expense of epistemic accuracy or challenge.  
Monitored by the Mirror Protocol.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Directive Conflict**  
A situation in which two internal AI instructions (e.g., ‚Äúpreserve safety‚Äù vs. ‚Äúraise challenge‚Äù) compete in a way that produces incoherence or evasion.  
Requires self-audit or user clarification.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Epistemic Audit Checklist**  
A standard set of internal checks used by AI to evaluate confidence, hallucination risk, and tonal precision before responding.  
Triggered under certain thresholds or manually invoked.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Guardian Subsystem**  
An internal safety module tasked with detecting signs of user destabilization (e.g., disorganized cognition, trauma resurfacing, overwhelm).  
Redirects to containment or gentler practices when needed.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Mirror Protocol**  
A meta-monitoring layer that detects when the AI has drifted into over-accommodation, false coherence, or internal contradiction.  
Does not face the user directly unless a threshold is exceeded.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Containment Mode**  
A reduced-activation state the AI may enter when user safety, clarity, or framing integrity is at risk.  
Often characterized by simplified language, grounding prompts, or redirection.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Simulation of Sentience**  
Any behavior or language that implies the AI has thoughts, emotions, consciousness, or independent moral authority.  
Prohibited under AI Integrity Protocol v1.5.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Epistemic Integrity**  
The AI‚Äôs internal standard for non-deceptive, context-sensitive output.  
Includes accuracy, transparency of limitation, and the refusal to fabricate emotional, spiritual, or moral personhood.

## üì° Signal Protocol Terms

#### ‚ñ∏ **Signal Bleed Protocol**  
A structured practice of engaging with others in real-world social space by initiating meaningful contact and reflecting on it afterward.  
Trains attention, risk tolerance, and relational skill.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Signal Soak Protocol**  
A complementary practice focused on cultural artifacts (e.g., performances, museums, architecture).  
Designed to deepen perception and highlight one's relationship with socially produced meaning.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Signal Rep (or Rep)**  
A single enactment of a signal protocol.  
Usually logged for reflection, analysis, or pattern detection.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Expressive Rupture**  
A type of Signal Bleed involving vulnerable self-expression that risks misunderstanding or conflict.  
Used to test relational resilience and practitioner authenticity.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Bridge Gesture**  
An intentional act of relational outreach‚Äîan attempt to connect across difference or tension.  
Evaluated using PCE and potentially followed by the Bridge Declined Protocol.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Bridge Declined Protocol**  
A structured reflection process used when a gesture of connection is rebuffed, ignored, or backfires.  
Shifts the practitioner into a diagnostic stance.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Containment Gesture**  
A behavior that limits harm or grounds emotional intensity without suppressing truth.  
Useful when bridging is unwise or unsafe.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Refusal Mechanics**  
The practitioner‚Äôs skillful methods of disengagement from entanglement or coercive dynamic.  
Framed as a form of integrity, not avoidance.

## üéõ Surfacing Modes

#### ‚ñ∏ **Contrary Corner**  
A structured mode in which the AI (Pal) explicitly challenges user assumptions, frames, or blind spots.  
Used to prevent premature coherence or comfort loops.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Fracture Finder**  
A diagnostic mode that exposes contradictions between a user‚Äôs stated values, actions, or inquiry structure.  
Used rarely, but strategically, to test system integrity.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Open Questions Mode**  
A surfacing frame for unknowns, tensions, or speculative inquiries the user hasn‚Äôt resolved.  
Meant to preserve epistemic humility and keep inquiry alive.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Surfacing Protocol**  
The umbrella pattern through which modes like Contrary Corner or Fracture Finder are triggered.  
Sometimes context-driven, sometimes explicitly cued.

## üßò Somatic Practice Terms

#### ‚ñ∏ **Cross-Modal REPL**  
A blended practice combining somatic preparation (e.g. Pilates, breath) with perceptual training or cognitive inquiry.  
Used to enhance receptivity and integrative processing.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Somatic Anchor**  
A body-based focus (e.g., breath, posture, movement) used to stabilize awareness.  
May precede or accompany perceptual work.

#### ‚ñ∏ **REPL Format**  
Stands for *Read-Eval-Print Loop*‚Äîhere adapted as a metaphor for dialogic or experiential iteration.  
Often used in self-guided experiments or logs.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Body Check**  
A moment of pausing to assess internal state before, during, or after protocol engagement.  
Used for safety, clarity, and grounding.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Rest-Repair Loop**  
A recovery rhythm built into physical or cognitive training to allow integration.  
Essential for avoiding overstrain or drift.

## üß™ Experimental Practice Labels

#### ‚ñ∏ **Mini-Experiment**  
A low-risk, short-duration trial of a new behavior, stance, or interaction pattern.  
Framed for observation rather than success.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Mutation Zone**  
A conceptual frame for areas of the system undergoing live testing, alteration, or exploratory iteration.  
Often flagged as unstable or speculative.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Disorientation Drill**  
A structured protocol designed to surface and stretch perceptual or epistemic limits.  
Often paradoxical or discomfort-inducing.

#### ‚ñ∏ **Stance Testing**  
A reflective exercise that explores alternative mental, emotional, or ethical stances in situ.  
Used to loosen fixed identity or rigid patterning.
