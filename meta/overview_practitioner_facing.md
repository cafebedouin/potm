# 🧠 Meta: Reflective Tools and Design Infrastructure

This folder contains diagnostic overlays, developmental lenses, and philosophical scaffolding that support **meta-cognition**, **practitioner development**, and **framework evolution** within *Pilates of the Mind*.

## 🔹 Meta-Tools (Practitioner-Facing)

These documents offer advanced diagnostic or calibration layers beyond core subsystems or frameworks.

- `stage_matrix_v1.0.md` – Maps developmental stages of practitioners to appropriate tools, questions, and risks.
- `shadow_overlay_v1.0.md` – Identifies common practitioner shadow patterns and repair prompts.
- `persona_lens_map_v1.0.md` – Shows how PoTM tools align with distinct practitioner archetypes.
- `advanced_practitioner_guide_v0.3.md` – Guides ethical, developmental practice at higher levels of skill.
- `dyadic_mirror_v1.0.md` – Lightweight peer review and real-time calibration capsule.
- `crisis_escalation_protocol_v1.0.md` – Emergency response process for rupture, destabilization, or harm.
- `self_assessment_checklist_v1.0.md` – Readiness evaluation for engaging in complex practice spaces.
- `quick_reference_card_v1.0.md` – On-the-spot triage and shadow tracking for active sessions.

## 🔸 Principles (Design-Level Philosophy)

These documents govern the ethos, naming, and structural values of the overall system. See subfolder:

[`/meta/principles/`](./principles/)

## 📐 Usage

Use these tools:
- **Before sessions** to reflect on readiness or calibrate protocol selection.
- **After sessions** to diagnose ruptures, shadow activation, or confusion.
- **Periodically** to track your developmental position as a steward, mirror, integrator, or explorer.

Use the design principles when:
- Extending the system
- Creating new protocols
- Resolving design disagreements

## 🧭 Orientation Note

**Meta does not mean superior**. These tools operate *above* the system only in an architectural sense. They are meant to serve practitioners, not to dominate their experience.

Meta is not the crown. It is the root.
