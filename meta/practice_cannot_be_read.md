# Principle: **Practice Cannot Be Read**

> **Realization cannot be transmitted.**  
> Books, instructions, and explanations are only **pointers**.  
> The work itself must be done in time, through practice.

---

## Core Statement

There is an unavoidable gap between:

- **Practice** — lived, temporal, embodied, iterative.
- **Documentation** — frozen, clean, representational.
- **Reading** — instant, smooth, simulated understanding.

Reading about practice **simulates** formation but does not **produce** it.

> **Insight is non-transferable.**  
> *Only repetition in time makes it real.*

---

## Implication

- Clarity **without** enactment = simulation.
- Documentation **cannot** carry the weight of the practice that produced it.
- **Understanding is not realization.**
- **Friction is not a barrier — it is the doorway.**

---

## Guidance

- Return to the work.  
- When reading feels like knowing, **treat that feeling with suspicion**.  
- Do not try to perfect the explanation before entering the practice.  
- **The gap is not a flaw — it is the structure of learning itself.**

## Closing Line

> **You cannot read your way into the thing.**
>  
> **You must do it.**
