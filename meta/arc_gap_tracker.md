# 🕳️ PoTM Gap Tracker

**Filename**: `core/meta/gap_tracker.md`
**Purpose**: Identify, track, and review areas within the PoTM framework that require development, revision, or deconstruction. Updated in alignment with the Epistemic Resilience Arc.

## Epistemic Resilience Arc Phases

| Phase          | Frameworks                       | Archetypes        | Core Action |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Detection      | DIP, Guardian, Boundaries        | Sentinel          | Self-Trust  |
| Engagement     | Cognitive Aikido, Signal Bleed   | Trickster, Weaver | Redirection |
| Deconstruction | Contrary Corner, Fracture Finder | Fool, Disruptor   | Unmasking   |

## I. Gap Categories

* **🛑 Detection Gaps**: Areas lacking early warning tools, beginner-level guidance, or self-trust calibration.
* **🌀 Engagement Gaps**: Underdeveloped practices for redirecting coherence, building resilience, or practicing friction skillfully.
* **💣 Deconstruction Gaps**: Missing tools for exposing the limits of frames, protocols, or practices.
* **🔄 Phase Cycling Gaps**: Lacking guidance for transitions, rhythms, or reintegration post-deconstruction.

## II. Active Gap List (August 2025)

### 🛑 Detection Gaps

* No formalized **Detection Drills** beyond passive markers
* No standardized **early warning checklist** for users who don't already have high metacognitive awareness
* No structured guidance on **emotional override detection** (e.g. in affectively loaded AI responses)

### 🌀 Engagement Gaps

* 🟡 No unified *“Engagement Pack”* for beginners (currently scattered)
* 🟡 No explicit *multi-frame playbook* for trying multiple interpretive stances quickly
* ❌ No standard practice for **“low-stakes engagement reps”** (comparable to sparring drills or kata)

### 💣 Deconstruction Gaps

* ❌ No formal **deconstruction protocols**—e.g., no tools explicitly designed to take apart even useful tools
* ❌ No **rotating adversarial mirror agent** (e.g., a model prompted only to challenge and deconstruct frames)
* ❌ No **timeline-based drift diagnostics** (e.g., what started useful but calcified?)
* 🔁 Sacred Nonsense needs **stabilization as ritual** not just aesthetic mode
* 🟡 No shared *“frame mortality logs”* – tracking which tools users had to discard over time (meta-reflection)

### 🔄 Phase Cycling Gaps

* ❌ No *rhythm suggestions* (daily/weekly/yearly cycles of arc movement)
* ❌ No **recovery prompts** post-deconstruction (e.g., restabilizing after nihilism or identity erosion)
* ❌ No journaling interface or logging protocol tied to arc phases
* ❌ No **feedback loop tracker** for observing how long users spend in each phase, or which they resist

**Legend**:

* ✅ = Actively developed with multiple tools
* 🟡 = Lightly addressed, one or two partial tools
* ❌ = Largely missing or unformalized
* 🔁 = In progress / gesturing toward presence but not yet solidified

## IV. Tagging Convention (Proposed)

| Tag   | Status                        |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| \[ ]  | Proposed / Open               |
| \[🔧] | In Progress                   |
| \[✅]  | Implemented                   |
| \[⚠️] | Requires Deconstruction Phase |

## V. Notes

This file tracks not only what is missing, but also *when to stop building.* Any item that risks becoming a new ossified frame will be tagged \[⚠️] and sent to Contrary Corner or the Fracture Finder pipeline.
