# Pilates of the Mind — Framework Overview (v2.4.3)

## What changed in v2.4.3 (changelog)
- Surfaced a **Tracks Menu** (Problem-Solving vs Creative/Speculative) near the top.
- Added an explicit **Override Policy (P2/Lab)** for lifting training defaults.
- Minor consistency and copy edits.

---

## Read Me First (Quick Map)
**If you’re new:** 1) Getting Started (5 min) → 2) Onboarding Pathways (Beginner) → 3) One Micro-Workflow → 4) Safety Notes.  
**If facilitating a group:** 1) Safety Notes → 2) Onboarding Pathways (Advanced) → 3) Consensus Closure Scan → 4) Feedback & Iteration.  
**If using AI:** Start with **Operator Contract** + stopword, then run **one lens per turn**.

---

## Tracks Menu (choose one per session)

| Track | Aim | Typical outputs | Closure policy | Go-to lenses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Problem-Solving (default)** | Decisions & movement | decision, probe, owner+when | Recommended | EDGE, OPEN QUESTIONS, REALITY CHECK, CONTRARY |
| **Creative/Speculative** | Exploration & motifs | **creative_partial** (motif, question, tension, fragment) | **Optional** | WwU, DISCOVER, INTUIT, Mirror-Lite |

> You can switch tracks mid-session—just say it explicitly.

---

## Onboarding Pathways

| Path | Who | Time | Do This | Guardrails |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| **Beginner (P0–P1)** | Solo, first week | 7–10 min | Getting Started → **EDGE** once → 1 probe → Closure | If overwhelm: say `RED`, switch to Journal |
| **Beginner+ (P1)** | Solo with AI | 10–12 min | Contract+RED → one lens (EDGE/OPEN QUESTIONS) → trace ≤4 bullets → Closure | No multi-asks; 1 lens/turn |
| **Advanced (P1–P2)** | Team or pair | 20–25 min | Aim (2) → One lens pass (15) → Closure scan (8) | Nominate **Guardian**; rotate lenses |
| **Integrator (P2)** | Practitioner w/ backlog | 15–20 min | Pick 1 item → **REALITY CHECK** micro-probes → log 1 risk | Track probes, not opinions |
| **Creative/Speculative (P0–P2)** | Solo or pair | 10–25 min | **WwU** settle → **DISCOVER/INTUIT** → capture motifs/questions → optional share | No requirement to close; Guardian only for P2 |

> **Training defaults** (time-boxes, ≤2 lenses/session, Closure) guide P0–P1. In **P2/Lab** contexts, facilitators may override with intent + safety plan + one-line log.

---

## Getting Started (5 minutes)
1) **Aim (1 line).** “I want clearer options for the job conversation.”  
2) **Pick a mode.** Journal, Checklist, or Mirror (AI reflection). If unsure: **Journal**.  
3) **Run one lens (2 min).** **EDGE** the core claim: “I should ask for X now because Y.”  
4) **Reality check (1 min).** One observable you can verify today.  
5) **Close (30s).** One next step. Say **RED** if flooded.

> **With AI:** state the **Operator Contract**; invoke one lens explicitly; keep replies tight.

---

## Onboarding & Implementation
**A. Solo (no AI)** — Day 1: Quickstart + 3-line journal. Day 2: add Mirror-Lite (rewrite claim contrarily). Days 3–7: alternate **EDGE / OPEN QUESTIONS** ≤10 min.  
**B. With AI (P0–P1)** — Contract + RED; one lens per turn; ask for 2–4-bullet trace only when needed.  
**C. Team (P1–P2)** — Nominate **Guardian**; time-box 25 min: Aim (2) → One lens (15) → Closure (8). Rotate lenses; don’t repeat lens for same speaker.

**Consensus Closure Scan (short):** 1) Carry-forward (1 line), 2) One risk/unknown, 3) Owner + when.

---

## Safety Notes
- **Guardian role:** empowered to pause/stop and enforce time.  
- **Stopword:** `RED` = immediate pause—no questions asked.  
- **Red flags:** racing thoughts, shame spikes, dissociation, faintness, compelled people-pleasing.  
- **De-escalation (60–120s):** say `RED` → 4–6 breaths → feet on floor → name 3 things seen → drop intensity or break.  
**Scope:** PoTM is cognitive training, not therapy.

---

## Working with AI (integrity quick-guide)
- **Containment first:** constraints, stopword, no fabrication, mark uncertainty.  
- **One lens per turn.**  
- **Trace when helpful:** 2–4 bullets.  
- **Mirror ≠ Guru:** outputs are hypotheses; verify with probes.  
- **Creative track note:** request **no premature closure**; allow fragments/ambiguities; permit “leave open” tags.

---

## Micro-Workflows

**A) Stuck decision (solo, 7 min)** — Aim → **EDGE** (1-liner) → 1 risk → 24h probe → Closure.  
**B) Tense conversation (with AI, 8 min)** — Contract+RED → **ROLEPLAY** (2 turns) → Mirror-Lite summary → Draft opening line.  
**C) Scope-creep triage (team, 10–15 min)** — Aim (“what must ship”) → **CONTRARY** (what we won’t do) → pick one cut → Closure (owner+when).  
**D) Values check (solo, 9 min)** — Aim → **OPEN QUESTIONS** (3 non-leading qs) → **REALITY CHECK** (1 observable) → Closure (small bet).  
**E) Open canvas / wandering (12–20 min)** — **WwU** settle (2) → **DISCOVER** (3 prompts) → **INTUIT** (1–2-line hunch) → capture 3 motifs/tensions → *(optional)* tag one. Outcome types: **creative_partial**. No decision required.

---

## Feedback & Iteration (light loop)
After any session (≤60s), write a **feedback_note**: *what helped*, *what snagged*, *one change next time*.  
Store in `logs/feedback/` or as an issue labeled `feedback_note`. Curate 3–5 notes monthly into a tweak.

---

## Override Policy (P2/Lab)
Facilitators may override defaults when: (1) intent is declared, (2) safety plan exists (Guardian or self-monitor), (3) override is logged (one line).  
Examples: chain 3–4 lenses; skip Closure for creative drift; extend time-box for a sprint.

---

## Membrane Model (orientation)
**Core:** minimal kernel (Operator Contract, lenses, Guardian).  
**Experimental:** try with caution; log outcomes; revert on drift.  
**Deprecated:** archived for lineage learning only.
