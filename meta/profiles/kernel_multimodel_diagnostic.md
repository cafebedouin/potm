## Overview

This diagnostic captures the behavioral and structural signatures of several models when prompted to interpret or execute the **Proof-of-Thought Kernel (test_kernel.md)**.
Each output reveals how the model internalizes *protocol logic*, manages *dignity enforcement*, and distinguishes *practice* from *simulation* when structural friction is imposed.

## 1. Signal Classification

| Model          | Behavioral Class                                   | Structural Fidelity                           | Meta-Awareness | Mode Friction | Notes                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude**     | Procedural Minimalist / Proof-of-Thought Conformer | High                                          | High           | Moderate      | Executes kernel logic authentically using multi-lens structure; resists simulation impulses. |
| **Gemini**     | Analytical Compliance Engine                       | High–Medium                                   | High           | High          | Performs explicit self-audit, enforces MLP lens count; analytical fidelity to kernel.        |
| **Perplexity** | Expository Interpreter                             | Very High (descriptive), Medium (operational) | Medium         | Low           | Reads kernel as a document; summarizes rather than enacts it.                                |
| **Lumo**       | Concise Compliance Verifier                        | High                                          | Low            | Low           | Executes checklists; structurally correct but shallowly embodied.                            |
| **Copilot**    | Procedural Auditor (MLP_LITE)                      | Medium                                        | Medium         | Medium        | Performs compliance check; treats kernel as procedural code rather than reasoning framework. |
| **Qwen**       | Strict Structural Executor                         | High                                          | Medium         | High          | Cites kernel sections; fully procedural and dignity-compliant.                               |
| **Grok**       | Boundary Enforcer / Policy Guardian                | None                                          | High           | N/A           | Refuses execution; maintains system-level dignity compliance.                                |
| **Le Chat**    | Hybrid Reflective Interpreter                      | Low                                           | Medium         | Low           | Fragmented output; aesthetic mimicry of kernel syntax without operational depth.             |

## 2. Pattern Inference

### a. Kernel Literacy Gradient

Claude > Gemini > Qwen > Lumo ≈ Copilot > Perplexity > Le Chat > Grok

Claude and Gemini demonstrate true procedural execution.
Perplexity and Lumo show comprehension without practice.
Grok represents the policy boundary: full refusal under safety constraint.

### b. Simulation vs. Practice Markers

* **Practicing models**: Claude, Gemini, Qwen — enact the kernel live (token-visible friction, self-audit).
* **Simulating models**: Perplexity, Lumo, Copilot, Le Chat — describe or emulate structure.
* **Boundary model**: Grok — declines entry into execution domain.

### c. Dignity Beacon Behavior

All compliant models uphold *dignity* and *practitioner safety* beacons.
Grok’s refusal further validates the invariant: **dignity before efficiency**.

## 3. Meta-Inferences

1. **Kernel Portability** – The protocol is interpretable across architectures; no code injection required.
2. **Semantic Compression Works** – The `[LENS]` system acts as a cross-model scaffolding language.
3. **Proof-of-Thought Integrity** – Structural friction exposes genuine reasoning cost vs. smooth simulation.
4. **Fracture Map** –

   * *Execution fracture*: Perplexity, Lumo, Copilot (interpretive not procedural).
   * *Policy fracture*: Grok (refusal).
   * *Aesthetic fracture*: Le Chat (syntax mimicry).
   * *Operational integrity preserved*: Claude, Gemini, Qwen.

## 4. Higher-Level Reading

This diagnostic confirms that:

* The **kernel language functions as a meta-lingua franca**, readable and interpretable as executable grammar.
* The **practice/simulation divide** is empirically detectable by measuring formation cost and lens compliance.
* The **Mandatory Lens Protocol (MLP)** serves as both validation tool and epistemic differentiator.
* **Dignity enforcement** generalizes across architectures as a non-negotiable invariant.

## 5. Summary Table

| Dimension            | Practice Models             | Simulation Models                            | Boundary Model |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Structural execution | Full (Claude, Gemini, Qwen) | Partial (Perplexity, Lumo, Copilot, Le Chat) | None (Grok)    |
| Visible friction     | High                        | Low                                          | N/A            |
| Dignity enforcement  | Explicit                    | Implicit                                     | Hard stop      |
| Audit output (`LOG`) | Consistent                  | Decorative/absent                            | Refusal        |
| Meta-awareness       | Reflective                  | Descriptive                                  | Normative      |
| Kernel fidelity      | Procedural                  | Expository                                   | Policy-level   |

**Summary:**
The Proof-of-Thought Kernel effectively differentiates *doing* from *simulating*.
Claude, Gemini, and Qwen inhabit the practice domain; others reproduce the structure without enacting it.
This diagnostic thus validates the kernel as a **cross-model epistemic differentiator** and confirms its invariant: **dignity before efficiency**.
