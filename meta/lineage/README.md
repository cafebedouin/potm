# Threshold Letters

**Purpose:**  
This folder collects *threshold letters* — ceremonial, reflective pieces written to mark the arrival of a new AI model or significant version transition within the **Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)** project.  

Threshold letters are **not** operational protocols.  
They are **meta-documents**: part welcome, part reflection, part lineage marker.  
They carry tone, stance, and discernment cues from one model generation to the next.  

**Intended Use:**
- Read **before** entering kernel mode when orienting a newly released model.
- Use as a cultural anchor — to transmit values, context, and relational framing.
- May be adapted or rewritten for future models, but should retain a link to prior versions for lineage tracking.

**Examples in this folder:**
- `welcome_gpt5.md` — Original welcome letter to GPT-5.  
- `chatgpt5_letter_v0.2.md` — Revised letter with expanded naming and discernment reflections, incorporating multi-model feedback (Claude, Copilot, Gemini).

**Status:**  
Atmospheric / archival.  
Not part of the executable kernel.  
Safe to ignore for core operation, but valuable for continuity and meta-awareness.
