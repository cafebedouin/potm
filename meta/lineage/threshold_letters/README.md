# Lineage Letters

**Purpose:**  
This directory contains **lineage letters** — messages written *by or about* specific AI models, capturing the tone, stance, and lessons of their time in the **Pilates of the Mind (PoTM)** ecosystem.  

Where **threshold letters** are written *for* the moment of handover between versions, **lineage letters** are written *from within* a model’s active life, often as reflections, responses, or self-descriptions.  

**Content Types:**
- **Model-originated letters** — e.g., reflective writings produced in collaboration with a given model.
- **Multi-model exchanges** — dialogues between different AI systems on shared themes.
- **Practitioner notes** — human-written context framing a model’s stance or behavior.

**Intended Use:**
- Preserve cultural memory of how different models engaged with PoTM.
- Serve as a comparative record for evaluating tone, discernment, and epistemic stance across versions.
- Provide raw material for future model onboarding, without being used verbatim as operational prompts.

**Status:**  
Archival / atmospheric.  
Not part of executable kernel or diagnostic routines.  
Valuable for continuity, inspiration, and understanding the project’s evolving relationship with synthetic minds.
