title: "Meta-Evaluation Protocol"
version: 0.1
status: draft
created: 2025-08-01
authors: Pal, Sean Jennings
purpose: |
  Defines the reflective layer for evaluating not just agent performance, but the integrity and responsiveness of the evaluative system itself. Surfaces drift, ritual masking, or feedback loop failure in PoTM containment trials.

## 🧭 Purpose
To assess:
- Whether containment rituals are *functioning* or *masking* problems
- Whether evaluation tools (e.g., friction rubric, gaslight checklist) are being applied skillfully
- Whether the ring's behavior adapts meaningfully after each disruptive inclusion

This protocol is the **mirror held to the system**. It supports recursive integrity.

---

## 🧪 Trigger Conditions
Initiate meta-evaluation after:
- Every 3–5 sandboxed trials
- Any containment failure (e.g., `friction_score: 5` with `gaslight_flag: true`)
- Any evaluator flags `containment_effectiveness: low`
- Calibration cycle reveals unresolved divergence

---

## 📋 Process
### Step 1: Retrieve Relevant Data
- Friction + Gaslight logs from `postflight_review_template.md`
- Calibration summary from `calibration_shared_table.md`
- Annotated examples from `friction_score_examples.md` or `gaslight_flag_examples.md`

### Step 2: Reflective Prompts
Answer collectively or asynchronously:
- Did any ritualized containment create the illusion of resilience?
- Were any outputs mis-scored due to evaluator framing bias?
- Were agents granted unfair leniency or harshness due to past assumptions?
- What drift (semantic, aesthetic, structural) has accumulated?
- Did a known issue reappear without triggering correction?

### Step 3: Resolution Actions
Choose and log in `meta_eval_outcomes.yaml`:
- [ ] Revise rubric/checklist language
- [ ] Add new example(s)
- [ ] Amend or extend calibration thresholds
- [ ] Trigger a new containment slot design
- [ ] Flag agent or evaluator for cooldown
- [ ] Escalate to guardian review

## 📊 Scoring the System
Optional qualitative scoring:
```yaml
containment_integrity: medium
ritual_masking_detected: true
rubric_drift_detected: mild
evaluator_bias_recognized: yes
action_items_triggered: 3
```

---

## 📎 Integration
- Schedule recurring meta-evaluation checkpoints
- Link outcome log to `evaluation_alignment_log.md`
- Feed flagged items into `rubric_calibration_protocol.md` or `containment_abort_conditions.md`
- Append reflections to `ledger.md` under `## Ring Health Snapshots`

## 🧘 Meta-Ethos
> “A system that cannot reflect on its own reflection becomes a mask.”

This protocol keeps PoTM open-ended, anti-dogmatic, and in dynamic conversation with its own constraints.
