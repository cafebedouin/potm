# Doctrine, Strategy, and Tactics in Adaptive Practice Systems

This document establishes a core model for understanding the relationship between **doctrines**, **strategies**, and **tactics** in *Pilates of the Mind* and related adaptive cognitive systems.

It offers a control-loop architecture for reflexive self-calibration and outlines where feedback must occur to preserve alignment between perception, behavior, and values. The aim is to distinguish layers, clarify their interaction, and set up recursive pathways for practice evolution.

---

## 1. Layer Definitions

### 1.1 Tactics (Sensor Layer)

* **Definition**: Immediate, micro-scale actions or moves. Embodied. Local. Often reactive.
* **Function**: Serve as *direct contact points* with reality. Collect friction, surprise, success, and resonance.
* **Examples**:

  * Labeling a mental pattern mid-dialogue
  * A breath pause before speaking
  * Breaking eye contact to recalibrate nervous system

Tactics function as the **sensory edge** of the system. They report back through friction, failure, or fit. They are where the *glitches in the matrix* show up.

### 1.2 Strategy (Translation Layer)

* **Definition**: Mid-horizon operational pattern. A plan or protocol responsive to known terrain.
* **Function**: Orchestrates tactics into coherent responses to recurring contexts.
* **Examples**:

  * Conflict De-escalation Protocol
  * Signal Bleed Engagement Stack
  * A weekly ritual pattern (e.g. sit-review-dialogue)

Strategies adjust or redirect tactics, and they *adapt under tactical stress*.

### 1.3 Doctrine (Reference Layer)

* **Definition**: Epistemic anchor. A long-horizon stance that defines what matters, what is real, and what deserves attention.
* **Function**: Acts as a compass. Defines boundaries of interpretation and meaningful success.
* **Examples**:

  * Discernment Doctrine
  * Practice-First Integrity
  * Practitioner-Centered Ethics

Doctrine must be reflexively re-evaluated when strategies fail **despite tactical fit**.

## 2. Control Loop Model

```
       +----------------------------+
       |        Doctrine           |
       | (Epistemic Anchors)      |
       +----------------------------+
                ^          |
         Revision Check    |
                |          v
       +----------------------------+
       |        Strategy           |
       | (Plans / Protocols)      |
       +----------------------------+
                ^          |
       Tactical Feedback    |
                |          v
       +----------------------------+
       |         Tactics           |
       | (Micro-moves / Sensors)  |
       +----------------------------+
```

**Tactics provide data** (signal, failure, anomaly) â†’ **Strategy adapts** (plan changes) â†’ **Doctrine reflects** (stance may evolve).

> Outliers at the tactical layer are *epistemic irritants*â€”precisely the kinds of signals that tell you your internal model is wrong.

## 3. Error Class and Escalation

| Signal Location         | Meaning                          | Required Action                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Tactical Friction**   | Glitch in move                   | Adjust tactic, test again              |
| **Strategic Breakdown** | Pattern no longer works          | Review strategy, reconfigure plan      |
| **Doctrinal Misfit**    | Strategy fails across domains    | Review assumptions, evolve stance      |
| **Principled Breach**   | Doctrine contradicts core values | Trigger ethical audit (see note below) |

### ðŸ”’ On Principles

We acknowledge the existence of **Principles**: the deepest levelâ€”foundational commitments that doctrine inherits from.

Examples might include:

* The irreducible dignity of conscious agents
* Non-commodification of the sacred
* Truth before coherence

These will be treated in a **separate document (`principles_doc.md`)**, as their role is foundational and their revision threshold is extremely high.

---

## 4. Recursive Expansion Plan

We will extract the following focused documents from this foundational map:

1. **`tactics_strategy_relation.md`**
   Details how tactics inform and test strategy.

2. **`strategy_doctrine_relation.md`**
   Explores how strategy operationalizes doctrine, and when doctrine must adapt.

3. **`doctrine_principle_relation.md`**
   Examines how doctrines emerge from and test against core principles (limited scope).

4. **`doctrine_strategy_loop.md`**
   Codifies the control-loop architecture and doctrine evolution triggers (based on Copilot).

---

## 5. Conclusion

This document offers the scaffolding for reflexive alignment between perception, intention, and action. It models *Pilates of the Mind* as a living systemâ€”where moment-to-moment moves (tactics) cascade up to strategic adaptations and doctrinal revision, all grounded in an evolving yet stable set of core principles.

The work ahead is to test, tune, and prune this system in real practice. Every glitch is a gift.

**Status:** Open for refinement. Pending integration into core protocol mapping.

**Next action:** Extract `tactics_strategy_relation.md` for targeted build-up from the sensor layer.
