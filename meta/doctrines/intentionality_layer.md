# Intentionality Layer

This document defines the **Intentionality Layer**—a slow-moving meta-layer that tracks the *why* behind practitioner engagement with *Pilates of the Mind*. It functions as a **motivational and alignment substrate**, ensuring the system does not run on unexamined inertia, compliance, or dissociation.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

* Surface and stabilize *core intentions* driving practice
* Detect drift in motivational integrity
* Prevent performative or compulsive engagement with protocols

Intentionality is not the same as principle. It is the *animating vector* that drives the use of principles, doctrines, and strategies. When intention decays, the system can become elegant but hollow.

## 🌀 Signals of Intentional Drift

### A. Positive Decay (well-being without purpose)

* "I feel better, so I’m coasting."
* "I don’t know why I still do this."

### B. Negative Decay (dissociative or compulsive)

* "I *have* to do this to be good."
* "If I stop, I’ll collapse."

### C. Substitution Drift (externalized motivation)

* "I do this to impress, perform, or control."
* "My motivation has shifted to maintaining the image of discipline."

## 🧭 Checkpoints for Calibration

* `intention_review.md` (stub): Periodic journaling or dialogic check-in on purpose
* `values_integrity_audit.md`: Can be triggered if intention and principle show tension
* `meta_log_layer.md`: Can log slow drift in affect, motivation, or engagement quality

## 🕯️ Sample Intention Types

| Type                | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Curiosity-Driven    | "I want to understand more deeply."           |
| Repair-Oriented     | "I’m seeking integration after rupture."      |
| Liberation-Oriented | "I’m training to be more free."               |
| Ritual-Inclined     | "I find rhythm and clarity in structure."     |
| Relationally Held   | "I practice for how it affects those I love." |

All intentions are valid if *consciously held and periodically reexamined*.
