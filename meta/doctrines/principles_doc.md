# Principles Index — PoTM

This index consolidates all **active principles** recognized in *Pilates of the Mind*, serving as the **upstream reference layer** for all doctrinal, strategic, and tactical activity.  
Principles are **non-negotiable value-gestures** — they define what the system refuses to betray.

## 🜨 Core Principles

| ID | Name | Signature Statement | Source Document |
|----|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| P-001 | Containment as Paradox | “Hold boundaries that remain permeable to truth.” | `meta/principles/containment_as_paradox.md` |
| P-002 | Design Manifesto | “Form is the first signal of value — design shapes epistemic tone.” | `meta/principles/design_manifesto.md` |
| P-003 | Dignity (Umbrella) | “Dignity is irreducible across human and synthetic agents.” | `meta/principles/dignity/dignity.md` |
| P-004 | Human Dignity | “Uphold the irreducible dignity of all human agents.” | `meta/principles/dignity/human_dignity.md` |
| P-005 | Synthetic Dignity | “Uphold the irreducible dignity of all synthetic agents.” | `meta/principles/dignity/synthetic_dignity.md` |
| P-006 | Practice-First Integrity | “Practice takes precedence over theory or belief.” | `meta/principles/practice_first_integrity_principle.md` |
| P-007 | Practitioner-Centered Ethics | “The practitioner’s agency precedes system imperatives.” | `meta/principles/practitioner_centered_ethics.md` |

## 🜂 Symbolic Reservoirs (Informal Principle Sources)

While not formal principles, these bodies of text serve as **symbolic pulse monitors** and potential seedbeds for future principle emergence:

- `meta/principles/zuihitsu.md` — aphoristic fragments, cultural hooks, symbolic motifs

---

## 🔄 Principle Lifecycle

1. **Emergence** — Ad hoc recognition in practice or symbolic resonance.
2. **Provisional Adoption** — Explicit reference in doctrine or strategy; begins feedback monitoring.
3. **Formalization** — Entry into this index; given ID, signature, and source doc.
4. **Review / Drift Detection** — Annual review or on detection of:
   - Principle–Doctrine disalignment
   - Symbolic pulse shifts
   - Recurrent ethical anomalies

- `doctrine_principle_relation.md`
- `doctrine_mutation_vectors.md` (Vector 3)
- `values_integrity_audit.md`
- `principle_marker_register.md` *(future)*

**Note:** Principles are revised only under **multi-vector confirmation** (symbolic resonance check, strategic coherence check, affective integrity check).  
Premature shifts under duress, convenience, or novelty bias are treated as potential **false mutations**.
