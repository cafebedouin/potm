# Doctrine Mutation Vectors

This document outlines the primary **vectors** by which *doctrine* evolves within the epistemic system of *Pilates of the Mind*. These vectors describe how slow-moving meaning frames encounter sufficient friction, drift, or contradiction to trigger revision, rupture, or refinement.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Vector 1: Cumulative Strategic Drift

* Strategies increasingly optimize for local performance
* Doctrinal reference becomes abstract or symbolic only
* Practitioners report unease or subtle betrayal of foundational stance

**Monitored via:**

* `meta_log_layer.md`
* Doctrinal Audit Fragments (in `strategy_doctrine_relation.md`)

---

## ðŸ“‰ Vector 2: Tactical Anomalies That Recur

* Tactics generate recurring epistemic friction, even when strategies adjust
* Anomalies span contexts or surface in different domains
* Downstream integration fails despite local success

**Flagged through:**

* Friction logs
* Affective Resonance Registry
* `glitch_gifts.md`

---

## ðŸ§­ Vector 3: Principleâ€“Doctrine Disalignment

* Doctrinal framing no longer resonates with active principles
* Strategies require reinterpretation or symbolic gymnastics to maintain alignment
* Core metaphors feel strained or reverse in meaning

**Detected via:**

* `principle_marker_register.md`
* Symbolic Pulse Map
* Values Integrity Audit

---

## ðŸŒª Vector 4: External Systemic Overwrite

* Practitioner is embedded in external systems (orgs, families, platforms) whose doctrine begins to dominate
* Subconscious adoption of external framings
* Internal practices reframe to accommodate without conscious choice

**Suggested detection tool:**

* `contextual_drift_sensor.md` *(proposed)*
* Practitioner journaling + `meta_log_layer.md`

---

## ðŸŒ€ Vector 5: Ontological Mutation

* Practitionerâ€™s sense of reality, agency, or selfhood shifts
* Prior doctrine feels like a half-truth or obsolete mask
* Expressive language becomes misaligned with felt understanding

**Intervention signals:**

* Recurring symbolic dissonance
* Emergent need for new glyphs or framing language
* Breach of the `Discernment Doctrine`

---

## ðŸ§ª Mutation Is Not Failure

Doctrine mutation is not epistemic failure. It is:

* A **consequence of honest contact with reality**
* A **signal of structural learning**
* A **threshold of adaptation** rather than a breakdown

Each mutation vector is best understood as an *invitation*, not a rupture.

---

## ðŸ”’ False Mutation Warning

Beware reactive doctrinal shifts when:

* Under social pressure or cognitive fatigue
* Strategically convenient but ethically hollow
* Driven by unexamined emotional states

**Recommended buffer:**

* Slow hold via `doctrine_revision_registry.md`
* Require symbolic and affective triangulation

---

## ðŸª¡ Design Note

Doctrine is not adapted casually. Mutation should **integrate across**:

* Symbolic resonance
* Strategic coherence
* Affective integrity
* Principle alignment

Where this is possible, mutation becomes metamorphosis.
