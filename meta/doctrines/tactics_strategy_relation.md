# Tactics–Strategy Relation

This document clarifies the relationship between **tactics** and **strategy** within *Pilates of the Mind*. It forms the lowest layer of the cascading epistemic loop that spans from embodied action to long-horizon values.

Tactics are **sensors**. Strategy is **translation**. Together, they form a loop of situated perception and adaptive reconfiguration.

## ⚡⧉ Tactics — Micro-Moves That Touch the Real

Tactics are:

* Moment-scale actions
* Often embodied
* Frictional and improvisational

**Examples**:

* Breath pause before reacting
* Labeling a mental impulse
* Breaking or initiating eye contact

Tactics are where the body and system meet. They offer raw data through friction, surprise, or resonance.

## 🧭⇄ Strategy — Patterns That Shape the Possible

Strategies are:

* Repeatable patterns of response
* Protocols, rituals, and flows
* Context-sensitive but doctrine-informed

**Examples**:

* Conflict de-escalation sequence
* Signal Bleed Protocol
* Weekly review stack

Strategy emerges from tactics, but also **constrains and shapes** them. The relationship is recursive.

## 🔁 Feedback Loop

| Feedback Path     | Description                          | Action Triggered                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tactic → Strategy | Tactic fails or generates anomaly    | Adjust strategy (swap sequence, insert buffer, remove step) |
| Strategy → Tactic | Strategy prescribes or adapts tactic | Change rhythm, framing, or available actions                |

### 🧪 Glitch Gradient (Optional Mapping)

Tactical anomalies can be differentiated by **glitch intensity**:

* 🟢 Tempo mismatch → Tweak sequence
* 🟡 Repetition fatigue → Strategy rotation
* 🔴 Frame collapse → Doctrinal escalation

Friction scores or anomaly tagging may help form a **Strategy Evaluation Buffer**, traceable via `meta_log_layer.md`.

## ⚠️ Misalignment Patterns

| Pattern          | Description                                  | Correction                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Ghost Ritual** | Strategy persists but tactics are disengaged | Reassess strategy fit or ritual fatigue |
| **Overfitting**  | Strategy replaces situational awareness      | Reintroduce tactical variability        |
| **Underfit**     | Tactics scatter without anchoring frame      | Deploy mini-strategy or ritual spine    |

## 🪡 Design Notes

* Tactics test *what works here*.
* Strategies test *what works when repeated*.
* Strategies must metabolize feedback from tactics or become dead.
* Tactics without strategic container become noise or habit.
* *Somatic or linguistic shifts in tactics—such as pronoun changes, gesture blocks, or sudden silence—can indicate upstream doctrinal strain.*
