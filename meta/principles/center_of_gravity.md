# Center of Gravity Principle (v1.1)

> *"Going further, we have the notion that a narrative should be defined by its heart and not by its borders. That ties in with my linguistic notions that things ought to be defined by prototype rather than by formula. It ties in to my refusal to define who is or is not a 'good' Perl programmer, or who exactly is or isn't a member of the 'Perl community'. These things are all defined by their centers, not by their peripheries."* — Larry Wall

## Core Principle
A system, practice, or community should be defined by the gravitational pull of its center — the qualities, values, and prototypes it attracts and sustains — rather than the policing of its boundaries. Cohesion emerges from alignment to the center, not from exclusion at the edges.

---

## Operational Additions

### 1. Center Definition Protocol
To reduce subjectivity and keep the center tangible:

- Identify **3–5 prototypes** that exemplify the center in action.  
- Prototypes are *real* — drawn from observed behavior, not idealized abstractions.  
- Use these as ongoing reference points for *alignment-to-center* decisions.  
- Avoid codifying prototypes into rigid rules — their function is gravitational, not regulatory.

---

### 2. Drift Detection & Re-Centering
Centers naturally drift. The work is to make this drift **visible, deliberate, and coherent**.

**Cadence:** Run at least quarterly, or when drift is suspected.

**Method:**
1. Review the 3–5 prototypes and note changes in shared perception.
2. Use *Fracture Finder* to surface divergences between stated values and lived practice.
3. Apply *Contrary Corner* to stress-test the current center — what would make it harmful or false?
4. If drift is beneficial, update the **Center Map** (the living record of prototypes).  
5. If drift is harmful, consciously *re-anchor* by amplifying centripetal practices and reducing noise.

---

### 3. Anti-Gatekeeping Safeguard
Consensus about the center must itself remain centripetal:

- **Opt-in process:** Participation is voluntary, not compulsory.
- **Invitational output:** Updates to the Center Map invite alignment; they are not enforcement tools.
- **Non-exclusionary frame:** Discussions are about *what we are deepening* rather than *who is in or out*.

---

## Implications
- Encourages adaptive integrity: the center can evolve without losing cohesion.
- Minimizes defensive energy spent on boundary policing.
- Aligns with PoTM’s emphasis on **prototype over formula** and **friction as signal**.

---

## Related Practices
- **Fracture Finder** — detect incoherence in self or system.
- **Contrary Corner** — challenge certainty to test strength.
- **Deconstruction Countdown** — plan to question even what works.

---

## Summary
The Center of Gravity Principle reframes identity from a perimeter to a gravitational well. Instead of defending edges, we deepen the heart — knowing that whatever truly belongs will be drawn closer, and whatever does not will drift away on its own.
