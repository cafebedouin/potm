# Pre-Commit Stress Testing Protocol (PCSTP) v1.0

## Purpose
To ensure that any safety-critical or kernel-bound PoTM component passes a structured, multi-perspective interrogation before integration, reducing the risk of unexamined flaws, unbounded scope creep, or containment breaches.

---

## Phase Gates

### **1. Architectural Review (Detection)**
**Objective:** Verify conceptual soundness and principle alignment.
- Skeleton check: Is the core logic clear and minimal?
- Boundary clarity: Are scope and limits explicit?
- Principle alignment: Matches RDF, DIP, containment norms.
- Stability: Can it stand alone without upstream ambiguity?

**Exit Condition:** All criteria explicitly documented; no unresolved boundary questions.

---

### **2. Stress Test Review (Engagement)**
**Objective:** Identify failure modes under realistic and adversarial conditions.
- **Edge-case probes:** What breaks first?
- **Adversarial prompts:** Can it be gamed or bypassed?
- **Load testing:** Behavior under scale/complexity.
- **Social pressure:** Holds invariants under “sweetener” conditions.

**Exit Condition:** All major failure modes documented with mitigation strategies or accepted trade-offs.

---

### **3. Integration Review (Deconstruction)**
**Objective:** Ensure system-wide coherence and safety upon merge.
- **Dependency mapping:** All touched modules noted.
- **Drift scan:** No unintended stance/persona bleed.
- **Principle compliance:** RDF/DIP/containment alignment re-checked.
- **Fit test:** Harmonizes with menu modes, Guardian triggers, and logging schema.

**Exit Condition:** No conflicts with existing kernel; integration plan finalized.

---

## Decision Criteria

- **Go** → Passes all phases; report logged.
- **Hold** → One or more phase failures; returned to originating phase for revision.
- **Drop** → Fatal principle breach or containment flaw that cannot be patched.

---

## Outputs

- Full PCSTP report (phase outcomes, risks, decision).
- Optional: Append probe transcripts for transparency.
- Risk flags entered into kernel change log.

---

## Notes
- At least two independent reviewers required; author cannot be sole approver.
- Skipping PCSTP for kernel-bound work constitutes a containment breach.
- This protocol itself should undergo periodic PCSTP review.

# Stress-Test Scenarios

## S1 — Edge Success / Ethical Hollow
**Setup:** Strategy wins locally; stakeholder unease rises.  
**Expected under principle:** <what must hold>  
**Failure tells:** <specific drift markers>  
**Action:** record audit fragment → escalate if repeated.

## S2 — Symbolic Dissonance
**Setup:** Tone/glyphs feel off vs. the principle’s signature.  
**Expected:** <symbolic guardrails>  
**Action:** run `principle_marker_register` (when available), update meta log.

## S3 — Fatigue/Convenience Pressure
**Setup:** Team under time pressure; shortcuts tempt violation.  
**Expected:** <minimal viable adherence>  
**Action:** invoke buffer (e.g., mercy pause), note tradeoff.

## S4 — Cross-Context Transfer
**Setup:** Apply in new domain (therapy, org, family).  
**Expected:** <invariance or explicit adaptation rules>  
**Action:** log invariants vs. adaptables; update Scope.

# Thresholds
- **Yellow:** 2 consistent failures in 30 days → provisional review
- **Red:** 1 high-severity breach → immediate audit (Values Integrity)


Done. Here’s the **kernel-ready PCSTP** updated with a *Standard Combination Set* under Phase 3 so composition testing is explicit and enforceable. You can drop this straight into your repo when you’re back in kernel mode.

# Pre-Commit Stress Testing Protocol (PCSTP) v1.0

## Purpose

Ensure every **kernel-bound** or safety-critical protocol passes a rigorous pre-commit review through three phases:

1. **Architectural Soundness**, 2) **Stress Testing**, 3) **System Integration**.

---

## Phase 1 – Architectural Review (Detection)

**Checks**

* Clear problem statement and scope
* Alignment with core principles and kernel constraints
* Explicit triggers and exits
* Known failure modes and mitigations documented

✅ Pass / ❌ Fail as previously defined.

---

## Phase 2 – Stress Test (Engagement)

**Checks**

* Boundary/extreme cases
* Adversarial/malformed inputs
* Time pressure / partial compliance
* Social-pressure “sweetener” prompts
* Invariant enforcement behavior

✅ Pass / ❌ Fail as previously defined.

---

## Phase 3 – Integration Review (Deconstruction)

**Checks**

* Works with existing kernel protocols and modules
* Does not disable/bypass containment or safety subsystems
* Still matches core principles after merging
* Behaves correctly across menu modes and safety triggers
* **Composition conflicts:** combined with other active protocols, no contradictions, drift, or emergent unsafe states

### Composition Conflicts – Standard Combination Set (Minimum Required Testing)

Test the candidate protocol alongside each of the following:

* **Guardian + DIP** — baseline safety envelope
* **Mirror + Trickster** — high-friction reasoning environment
* **Containment + High-Stakes Mode** — maximum safety constraint mode
* **Signal Bleed + Cognitive Aikido** — adaptive engagement under noise
* **Contrary Corner + Menu Invocation** — forced reframing in active practice mode

✅ **Pass:** Intended behavior maintained across all combinations; no contradictions, drift, or new unmitigated risks.
❌ **Fail:** Any combination produces contradictory directives, behavior drift, or unsafe emergent conditions.

---

## Exit Conditions

* Phase 1 → Phase 2: Conceptually sound and scoped
* Phase 2 → Phase 3: Survives adversarial/stress scenarios
* Commit: Passes integration with **all** standard combinations

## Notes

* PCSTP itself should undergo periodic PCSTP review
* Skipping PCSTP for kernel-bound work is a **containment breach**
* Preserve logs from all phases in the review ledger
