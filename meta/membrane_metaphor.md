# Membrane Metaphor – Bazaar / Cathedral / Hall of Fame

This triadic metaphor frames the **Pilates of the Mind (PoTM) repository membranes**.  
It encodes the lifecycle of ideas and documents with **ritual clarity** and **archival dignity**.

---

## 1. **Bazaar → Experimental**
- **Character**: Open, improvisational, generative  
- **Function**: Living market of ideas; encourages rapid iteration and mutation  
- **Behavior**: Anything can appear; nothing is guaranteed to persist  
- **Folder**: `/experimental/`

---

## 2. **Cathedral → Core**
- **Character**: Stable, curated, intentional  
- **Function**: Houses canonical frameworks, protocols, and enduring scaffolds  
- **Behavior**: Represents mature practice and structural integrity  
- **Folder**: `/core/`

---

## 3. **Hall of Fame → Deprecated**
- **Character**: Honored retirement, archival dignity  
- **Function**: Preserves lineage and historical context of ideas  
- **Behavior**: Serves as a **gallery of ancestors** rather than a discard pile  
- **Folder**: `/deprecated/`

---

## Notes
- Promotes **ritual respect for lifecycle**: no idea is lost, each is contextualized.  
- Strengthens **membrane clarity**: readers instantly know the maturity and function of any artifact.  
- **Optional Glyph**: 🏛️/🎪/⭐ could visually mark each membrane in docs or indexes.
