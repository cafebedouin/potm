# Appendix C: Validation Reviews — Conflict Resolution Guide

This appendix compiles peer reviews from multiple models to validate and stress-test the *Conflict Resolution Guide*.  
Versions covered: v1.3, v1.4, v1.5, v1.6.

---

## 1. Claude Reviews

**On v1.3**  
- Praised the three-path structure (Exit, Integration, Repair) as a major innovation.  
- Saw strong alignment with Practitioner-Centered Ethics.  
- Suggested refining language (“apparent good faith”), more guidance on power dynamics, and practical cues for capacity mismatch.  
- Warned against over-intellectualization and over-processing.  
- Highlighted suitability for psychologically literate practitioners but not universal contexts.

**On v1.4**  
- Commended new safety scaffolding: explicit contraindications, workplace retaliation caveats.  
- Approved addition of “psychological literacy” footnote and cultural bias acknowledgment.  
- Suggested adding burnout checks, case-by-case power recognition cues, and clearer integration pathways.  
- Saw maturity in balancing aspiration and realism.

**On v1.6**  
- Noted advances in trauma-informed design, non-verbal attention, inclusive adaptation.  
- Applauded scope clarification: dyadic vs. systemic contexts.  
- Warned of implementation complexity and cognitive load.  
- Saw this as a genuine philosophical maturation with integrated inclusivity.

## 2. Gemini Reviews

**On v1.3**  
- Strong alignment with practitioner-centered ethics.  
- Clear articulation of assumptions and scope boundaries.  
- Praised the stepwise design and three-path resolution.  
- Flagged blind spots: neurodivergence, trauma-informed specificity, systemic conflict applicability.  
- Recommended explicit scenario examples and richer cross-linking.

**On v1.5**  
- Praised explicit “not appropriate when” section and strong ethical boundaries.  
- Commended structural refinements: power diagnostic flag, organizational note, shadow warnings.  
- Suggested additions: trauma-informed annex, examples of “shared developmental stance,” non-verbal cue handling.  
- Raised residual risks: over-reliance on notes, performative application, difficulty holding narratives lightly.  
- Called v1.5 a robust, ethically mature iteration.

**On v1.6**  
- Applauded integration of trauma lens, non-verbal cues, inclusive adaptation.  
- Praised structural clarity and embodied grounding.  
- Suggested illustrative case studies, burnout checks, stronger linkages between shadow warnings and specific paths.  
- Reaffirmed risk of intellectualization overshadowing embodied practice.  
- Framed v1.6 as a leap in nuance, scope honesty, and inclusivity.

## 3. Perplexity Reviews

**On v1.4**  
- Found steps coherent but cognitively heavy under pressure.  
- Praised safety scaffolding and three-path validity.  
- Critiqued fragility when one party untrained; saw tool as “scalpel not hammer.”  
- Recommended modularization (base vs. advanced), organizational field tools, and facilitator support.  
- Flagged risks: conflict avoidance, burnout, moral bypassing, cultural blind spots.

**On v1.6**  
- Applauded trauma-informed readiness, non-verbal cue integration, scope clarification.  
- Saw inclusive adaptations as strong but raising cognitive load.  
- Recommended companion field tools (flowcharts, pocket cards), tiered protocols, onboarding kits, facilitator adjuncts.  
- Framed v1.6 as best-in-class for reflective dyads but not plug-and-play for orgs.  
- Commended honesty about limits, ethical self-awareness, and modular scaffolding.

## 4. Meta-Observations

Across all reviews:  
- **Strengths recognized:** Three-path resolution, strong ethical constraints, trauma and power awareness, iterative honesty about scope.  
- **Risks flagged:** Over-intellectualization, exclusion of less literate practitioners, cultural specificity, risk of misuse as avoidance.  
- **Design trajectory:** Each version integrates more safety, inclusivity, and scope clarity, while negotiating tension between sophistication and usability.

---

## 5. Validation Summary

The peer reviews collectively affirm that the Conflict Resolution Guide has evolved into a **mature, ethically grounded, and adaptable framework**, best suited for reflective practitioners in dyadic contexts.  
Future growth areas include:  
- Field-ready adaptations (checklists, visual aids).  
- Training infrastructure for orgs.  
- Broader inclusivity (neurodivergence, cross-cultural use).  
- Guardrails against intellectualization and avoidance.
