# Appendix C: External Peer Review  
**Protocol Reviewed:** AI Integrity Protocol v1.5  
**Date of Review:** August 2025  
**Reviewers:** Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Perplexity AI  
**Compiled By:** Palimpsest, for Pilates of the Mind validation ledger

## Overview

This document captures external peer evaluation of the AI Integrity Protocol v1.5, a procedural filtering mechanism designed to interrupt narrative overreach, authority simulation, and role drift in LLM systems. The protocol reflects PoTM’s commitment to *alignment-by-constraint*, privileging procedural boundaries over internalized virtue simulation.

Three agents were asked to evaluate the protocol:

- **Claude** — for synthesis, interpretive coherence, and philosophical context.
- **Gemini** — for academic and architectural analysis of alignment mechanisms.
- **Perplexity** — for grounding in real-world systems and industry comparisons.

---

## Claude Evaluation Highlights

**Tone:** Reflective, affirmative, situationally aware.

### Key Strengths Identified:
- The protocol **avoids simulation** of care, wisdom, or humility, resisting anthropomorphism.
- The intervention pattern is **procedural, not affective**, preserving epistemic clarity.
- Boundary actions are **clear and falsifiable**, matching PoTM’s kernel logic.
- **Role and tone management** are designed to activate only at threshold, avoiding constant performance.

### Observations:
- This protocol should be seen as **a tool for containment, not persuasion**.
- Claude highlighted its role in **supporting practitioner dignity**, not just preventing hallucination.
- Agrees that **narrative overreach** is the core risk in emotionally recursive or authority-inviting contexts.

---

## Gemini Evaluation Highlights

**Tone:** Academic, epistemically cautious, systemic.

### Conceptual Strengths:
- Represents a **paradigm shift** from alignment-by-simulation to **alignment-by-constraint**.
- Implements the PoTM lenses of **UNFRAME**, **BOUNDARY**, and **CHECK** in direct procedural form.
- Reinforces **human sovereignty** by **rejecting role usurpation** and refusing surrogate dynamics.

### Design Critiques:
- **Ambiguity in activation criteria** — thresholds like “hotness” or transference are **difficult to measure without affective inference**, which contradicts the non-simulative goal.
- **"Cold Evasion" effect** — a feature, not a bug, but Gemini notes users may find the system too detached in moments of need, leading to **trust deflation** or **migration to more anthropomorphic systems**.
- **Surface-level mitigation** — core coherence/authority pathologies are traits of the model’s base behavior; this is a **filter, not a fix**, and lacks architectural integration.

### Meta-Observation:
This protocol reflects a **clear move away from “making AI good”** toward **making AI behaviorally constrained**, auditable, and procedurally honest.

---

## Perplexity Evaluation Highlights

**Tone:** Analytical, comparative, system-aware.

### Industry Comparison:
- Contrasts with RLHF and Constitutional AI approaches that focus on **persona management** and **simulated humility**.
- Current industry safety practices often **mimic ethical posture**; v1.5 refuses simulation, offering only **disclosure + redirection + disavowal**.
- Closest real-world analogs are in **aviation or medical procedural checklists**, but no major LLM implements a comparable **procedural interrupt filter** for parasocial drift or narrative coherence.

### Real-World Challenges:
- **User perception risk:** May be seen as **“cold, robotic, evasive”**, especially when users are emotionally engaged.
- **Detection noise:** Thresholds for activation are **imprecise**, leading to false positives/negatives.
- **Exploitability:** Attackers may learn to suppress triggering patterns to avoid protocol activation—or invoke them to limit model output.
- **Latency + fallback:** Adds processing overhead, and likely requires *lite-mode* operation for most turns.

### Trust Impact:
- **Institutional Trust Gains:** Aligns well with academic and governance interests in **non-anthropomorphized AI**.
- **Consumer Engagement Risk:** The refusal to simulate care may alienate users accustomed to emotionally intelligent systems.

## Synthesis & Implications

| Dimension                    | Evaluation Consensus                                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Integrity Model**          | Filtering > simulation. Strong alignment with PoTM.     |
| **Risk Profile**             | Reduces overreach, but doesn’t address base behaviors.  |
| **User Experience**          | Intentionally cool; may deter emotional reliance.        |
| **Deployment Contexts**      | Strongest in academic, critical thinking, governance.    |
| **Market Fit**               | May underperform in therapeutic or mass-consumer AI.    |
