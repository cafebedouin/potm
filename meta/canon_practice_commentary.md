## Kernel Framework

**Canon:** The fixed point that anchors values. Provides gravity, prevents drift.  
**Practice:** The enactment of values in lived form. Provides orbit, adaptation, continuity.  
**Commentary:** The interpretive layer that mediates between canon and practice. Provides light, reinterpretation, vitality.  

### The Loop
- Canon constrains practice.  
- Practice generates commentary.  
- Commentary reframes canon.  

Failure modes:  
- **Ossification:** Canon without commentary.  
- **Dissolution:** Practice without canon.  
- **Drift:** Commentary without canon.  

### Determinants of Rigidity vs Fluidity
1. **Source of Authority** — revelation vs precedent vs consensus.  
2. **Medium of Canon** — text vs ritual vs code vs style.  
3. **Scale of Community** — small networks vs mass movements.  
4. **Threat Environment** — persecution vs safety.

## Interpretive Layer

### Comparative Models
- **Religion:** scripture (canon), ritual (practice), exegesis (commentary).  
- **Law:** constitution (canon), rulings (practice), precedent/scholarship (commentary).  
- **Technology:** protocol (canon), implementation (practice), docs/forums (commentary).  
- **Art:** manifesto (canon), performance (practice), criticism/curation (commentary).  

### Timing
- Early: fluid, soft-tissue.  
- Mid: crystallization under stress (scale, schism, threat).  
- Late: canon ossifies, commentary sustains life.  

### Commentary’s Paradox
Reveres the canon, wrestles with it. Vital commentary is both devotion and subversion.  

---

## Applications
- **Organizational Design:** mission (canon), operations (practice), retrospectives/town halls (commentary).  
- **Conflict Resolution:** identify which layer dominates or fails.  
- **Innovation:** balance originality with fidelity to canon.  
- **Education:** teach not only the canon but the history of its practice and commentary.

## Notes
- This framework itself is canonized here as kernel.  
- External model perspectives (Claude, Gemini, Le Chat, etc.) are recorded as *commentary artifacts*.  
- Practitioners should maintain the loop, not collapse into any single layer.
