# Developmental Stance — PoTM Repository

This repository is structured to make **developmental status** clear through architecture, not disclaimers.

## Directory Semantics

- **idea_garden/** — Exploratory concepts, sketches, and provocations.  
  Expect incompleteness, contradiction, and drift. Purpose is to seed, not to settle.  
- **canon/** — Stable, field-tested materials.  
  These are the “working kernel” of PoTM practice. Integrity and coherence expected.  
- **archive/** — Retired or superseded materials.  
  Preserved for lineage learning; not active for practice.

## Metadata

Each file carries YAML front-matter indicating its **status** (`draft`, `active`, `retired`) and **stability** (`experimental`, `stable`).  
These serve as quick cues if you encounter a fragment outside its directory context.

## Practitioner Responsibility

PoTM is a system for cultivating **discernment**, not for outsourcing it.  
- Fragments in the *idea_garden* should be approached as experiments.  
- Materials in *canon* should still be tested against lived context.  
- Nothing in *archive* is prescriptive; it is lineage record only.

If you encounter a fragment detached from this structure, check its metadata.  
The **burden of discernment** always rests with the practitioner, not the document.

## Membrane Reminder

- **Simulation may inform, but it may not testify.**  
- **Draft ≠ doctrine.**  
- **Location and metadata are the context.**

This is the epistemic hygiene layer: **trust the architecture, not inline disclaimers.**
