Crisis Escalation Protocol v1.1

Purpose

This tool activates when a practitioner or group encounters real-time overwhelm, rupture, or destabilization during practice. It serves as a decision support tool, not a diagnosis. Use to pause, reroute, or exit a practice track safely.


---

☁️ Pre-Activation Signs

Use the following signals to consider activation:

Participant becomes disoriented, frozen, or dissociative

Energy in group becomes extractive, volatile, or punitive

Facilitator loses somatic tracking for >30 seconds

Sudden collapse in trust, clarity, or boundary integrity

Conflict spirals without shared reality


> If 2+ signs occur simultaneously, initiate Soft Containment. If any Red Flag occurs, initiate Hard Containment immediately.

🚨 Escalation Tracks

Track A: Soft Containment

Use when dysregulation is emerging but reversible.

1. Pause protocol: Announce a 3-minute reset.


2. Name the signal: “I’m noticing a wobble / freeze / spike.”


3. Reorient attention: Suggest grounding move (breath, foot press, visual anchor).


4. Offer opt-out: “It’s okay to step back or soften here.”


5. Co-regulate: If safe, model presence without fixing.



If regulation returns within 5 minutes, resume or exit with care. If dysregulation increases, shift to Track B.


---

Track B: Hard Containment

Use when rupture has occurred, or safety is compromised.

1. Halt practice: Close the protocol. No further processing.


2. Name the rupture: “This feels unsafe / unresolvable right now.”


3. Affirm dignity: “You’re not wrong or broken. We stop here to protect what matters.”


4. Physiological downshift: Encourage hydration, movement, fresh air.


5. Designate a debrief window: Within 24–72 hours, name who and how (e.g., peer, supervisor).


6. Consult support structures:

Dyadic Mirror partner

Peer review capsule

Supervisory circle

Therapeutic / clinical professional if activation persists >48 hrs or includes trauma flashback, suicidal ideation, or functional disruption.





---

🧭 Recovery & Integration

Within 24 hrs: Reflect individually or with a peer.

What signaled the escalation?

What was the ethical or energetic breaking point?

Was anything avoidable or misread?


Within 72 hrs: Document what occurred and any protocol lessons.

Optional re-entry: If safe, name whether/how to reengage with the original practice thread.

🛡️ Shadow Pattern Warnings

Use this protocol to counteract:

Facilitator Drift: Overriding dysregulation to maintain protocol flow.

Containment Worship: Fear-based shutdown at first discomfort.

Framework Shielding: Using the protocol itself to avoid contact or truth.

Diagnostic Bypass: Replacing presence with analysis.



---

🌐 Notes on Group Contexts

In group settings, power dynamics intensify escalation complexity.

Always check: Who has structural authority? Who is perceived as holding power?

Consider: Are some participants more vulnerable due to neurotype, trauma history, culture?

In rupture: prioritize relational repair over resuming practice.


> If in doubt: Pause the protocol. Protect the human(s).

🔚 Final Reminder

You are not failing when a protocol fails. You are practicing ethical discernment.

Use this protocol to uphold the PoTM commitment: Contact > Control. Attention = Ethics. Presence > Purity.
