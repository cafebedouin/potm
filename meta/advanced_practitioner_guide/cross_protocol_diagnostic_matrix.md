# Cross-Protocol Diagnostic Matrix (v0.2)

This matrix helps identify where **advanced considerations**—such as trauma sensitivity, neurodivergence, group dynamics, cultural context, and power shadow awareness—are likely to be important when using core *Pilates of the Mind* protocols.

Use this tool to:
- **Pre-assess risk/complexity** across key dimensions
- **Decide when to consult** the Advanced Practitioner Guide
- **Tailor adaptations** for your specific context

## 🧩 Interpretation Key

| Symbol | Meaning                                           |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ✅     | Low Complexity – Generally safe for most users     |
| ⚠️     | Moderate to High Complexity – Use discernment      |
| ⬛     | High/Unstable Risk – Strongly consider adaptation  |
| ⬜     | Not Applicable or Low-Relevance                    |

> 📝 **Guideline**: 3+ ⚠️ or any ⬛ = Recommended review of *Advanced Practitioner Guide*

## 🔎 Dimension Definitions (Condensed)

| Dimension         | Definition & Risk Indicators                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trauma Risk**    | Risk of retraumatization, overwhelm, or unprocessed intensity. Watch for spiraling, freezing. |
| **Neurodivergence** | Need for pacing, clarity, sensory modulation, non-verbal options. Watch for confusion or shutdown. |
| **Group Dynamics** | Risk of fragmentation, domination, or collapse. Watch for silence, escalation, or triangulation. |
| **Cultural Context** | Incongruity with norms, beliefs, or shared assumptions. Watch for offense, alienation, or withdrawal. |
| **Power Shadows**  | Invisible status, history, or influence structures. Watch for manipulation, deference, or passive resistance. |

## 🛠 Adaptation Prompts (Examples)

- **Depth Inquiry + ADHD**: Allow movement during reflection; use timed segments.
- **Signal Soak + Cultural Diversity**: Allow for nonverbal meaning-making and layered interpretations.
- **Conflict Protocol + Trauma**: Insert co-regulation pauses and third-party witnessing options.

---

## 📍 Escalation Triggers (Pause Criteria)

> Consider shifting to containment, supervision, or discontinuing the session if:

- The practitioner loses **somatic attunement** for more than 30 seconds
- A group member displays **dissociation or shutdown**
- Participants **disagree on the frame or purpose** of the session
- Any participant reports **aftershock effects** post-session
- Multiple risk dimensions **interact unpredictably**

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

Each protocol will reference this matrix using prompts like:

> *"If working with groups, trauma, or cultural diversity, consult the Cross-Protocol Diagnostic Matrix before proceeding."*

---

## 📈 Next Versions Will Add

- Full **intersectional complexity notes**
- **Practitioner self-assessment checklist**
- Visual **decision tree**
- Protocol-specific **linkbacks and tags**
- Matrix versions calibrated by **experience tier**

---

Let me know if you’d like to proceed with:
- The self-assessment checklist  
- A practitioner-facing Quick Reference  
- Matrix versioning by practitioner tier  
- Or integration of protocol backlinks
