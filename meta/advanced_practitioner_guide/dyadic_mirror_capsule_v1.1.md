Dyadic Mirror Capsule (v1.1)

> A lightweight peer review ritual for ethical calibration, shadow detection, and co-regulation support between advanced practitioners.




---

🧭 Purpose

To expose blind spots, metabolize difficult facilitation experiences, and refine ethical stance through non-hierarchical peer reflection.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles

Mirror: Holds structured reflection space, primarily listening.

Practitioner: Brings a real moment of ethical ambiguity, friction, or uncertainty.


Note: Role rotation is encouraged after each session.


---

⏱️ Format (20–30 minutes)

1. Check-In (2–3 min)

Each shares current somatic/emotional state.

Note: If either is dysregulated, pause or reschedule.


2. Situation Presentation (5–7 min)

Practitioner describes:

Event or facilitation moment

Internal response (somatic, emotional, cognitive)

Ethical tension or ambiguity perceived


3. Mirroring (5–7 min)

Mirror reflects without judgment:

What patterns seem present?

Any practitioner shadow patterns observed?

Body language, pacing, tone feedback


> Optional Prompt: "If this were me, what would I fear I might be missing?"



4. Joint Reflection (5–10 min)

Open dialogue:

What felt metabolized or clarified?

Was there contact with discomfort, not just insight?

Any shifts in perception or somatic awareness?


5. Closing Somatic Check (1–2 min)

Each partner scans body:

Residue, tension, activation?

Anything unspoken?


> "Are we complete for now?" — pause, then affirm or surface what remains.

🧠 Shadow Pattern Reminders

Mirror may gently note if any of the following arise:

Framework Shielding (hiding behind jargon, models)

Facilitator Drift (subtle self-importance or rescue stance)

Containment Worship (clinging to calm vs. contact)

Diagnostic Bypass (over-analysis vs. relational presence)



---

⚠️ Power Differential Acknowledgment

If dyads differ by seniority, social location, or institutional power:

Mirror should step down in tone and center mutuality

Consider brief mutual disclosure: "Here’s one power angle I’m aware of..."



---

🔁 Suggested Frequency

Minimum: Monthly for active facilitators

Ideal: After any complex session or known ethical friction point



---

🌱 Optional Extensions

Group Mirror Variant: Three practitioners, one mirror + two responders

Written Reflection Log: Bullet summary of insights (private or shared)

Longitudinal Tracker: Note recurring shadow patterns over time



---

📝 Closing Notes

The Dyadic Mirror is not supervision, therapy, or evaluation. It is a relational mirror—an offering of perception, presence, and care in service of ethical practice.

Use it to feel again, see again, and begin again.
