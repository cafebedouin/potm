# Meta-Artifact: No Guarantees

PoTM makes no promises. It is an ongoing experiment whose tools, concepts, and practices may only work in the moment of their creation—perhaps only for their creator. They might resonate with a handful of people, or eventually with many. **Failure remains possible. So does surprise.**

## When Things Don't Work

Failed experiments leave behind something valuable: traces of exploration. A kernel that doesn't click, a journaling practice that feels forced, a somatic exercise that falls flat—these aren't dead ends. They're compost for what comes next.

Failure and success seed different kinds of growth:
- **Failure** tends to deepen insight. It forces us to confront our limits, question our assumptions, and redraw our maps.
- **Success** more often seeds optimization—making what already works cleaner, faster, more efficient within its established frame.

## The Bus Station, Reconsidered

The Helsinki Bus Station Theory advises: stay on the bus long enough for your path to diverge into something uniquely yours. PoTM embraces this wisdom while extending it:

The bus doesn't guarantee you'll reach the destination you imagined when you first bought your ticket. The route may wind through territories you never expected to see. The journey may change you so completely that your original destination no longer matters.

This metaphor deliberately remains incomplete. Life, like any transit system, resists full mapping. When the bus finally stops, the journey isn't "finished"—it's simply where you happened to get off.

## Three Orientations

**Process over artifact.** The things we make are waypoints, not the vehicle itself.

**Experiment over guarantee.** PoTM might fail entirely. When it does, that failure isn't waste—it's material for what's next.

**Surprise over certainty.** Committing to the process may reveal not what we were looking for, but what turned out to be possible.

## The Only Promise

PoTM is art as process. It may work, or it may not. The only commitment it asks is to the ride itself—to staying curious about where the next stop might be.
