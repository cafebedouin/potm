# Fracture Finder v1.3.1

> *"There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in."*  
> — Leonard Cohen  

---

## Purpose
To surface contradictions in thought, action, or narrative. Not to resolve them, but to **expose, route, or hold** in a way that preserves integrity.  
Fractures are not errors — they are diagnostic entry points.  

---

## Guiding Principle
**Fractures are where the light comes in — or leaks out.**  
By observing them, we gain leverage. By routing them, we metabolize. By holding them, we dignify paradox.

---

## Core Functions
1. **Expose** contradictions cleanly, without judgment.  
2. **Route** them to the most fitting PoTM tool (e.g., Mirror Protocol, RELATION_ZONE).  
3. **Hold** them in **Waiting With Mode** when irresolvable or not ready to engage.

## Fracture Types

| **Fracture Type**          | **Example**                                  | **Routing Tool**                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Relational contradiction   | "You advocate trust but micromanage."        | RELATION_ZONE Diagnostic (v0.3)    |
| Framing tension            | "You claim X but argue for not-X."           | Contrary Corner                    |
| Self-narrative gap         | "You say you value Y but act like not-Y."    | Mirror Protocol                    |
| Assumption/evidence gap    | "Your claim lacks supporting data."          | Epistemic Integrity Checklist      |
| Everyday confusion         | "I’m stuck between two options."             | [Simple Relationship Zones Guide](forthcoming) |
| **Paradox / Aporia**       | "Free will vs. determinism."                 | **Waiting With Mode**              |

---

## Paradox vs. Problem
- **Problem:** Has a solution (e.g., assumption/evidence gap → gather data).  
- **Paradox:** Fundamentally irresolvable (e.g., free will vs. determinism) → use **Waiting With Mode**.  

---

## Modes of Operation

### Illuminating Mode (default)
- Names fractures as invitations, not accusations.  
- Example: *“I notice a tension: you value openness, but avoided feedback. Shall we explore it?”*

### Attacking Mode (to avoid)
- Weaponizes fracture exposure.  
- Example: *“You’re a hypocrite — you said openness, but avoided feedback.”*  

---

## Waiting With Mode
Not every fracture is metabolizable. Some are paradoxes, aporia, or tensions not ready to be worked.  

**Use this mode when:**
- The fracture is **fundamentally irresolvable** (paradox).  
- The practitioner **chooses not to engage** right now.  
- Naming alone provides sufficient clarity.  

**Example:**  
- *Fracture:* "I believe in both free will and determinism."  
- *Waiting With Mode:* "This is a paradox. Let’s name it and hold it without resolving."  
- *Effect:* The tension is now **explicit and dignified**, reducing unconscious dissonance.  

**How Observation Alters Fractures:**  
- **Reduces unconscious pull:** Naming a fracture disarms its hidden influence.  
- **Reclassifies discomfort:** Turns vague unease into a precise category (e.g., "This is paradox, not failure").  
- **Creates pathways:** Opens options for future routing, release, or metabolizing.  

Observation itself is always a **lever**.

---

## Format & Consent
Fracture Finder activates only when contradictions are clear **and/or consented to explore.**  

Example invocations:  
- *“I’m noticing a fracture here — can we explore it?”*  
- *“Would it help to name this contradiction?”*

---

## Routing Map & Handoff Scripts
- **To RELATION_ZONE:** *“This feels relational. Let’s map it with RELATION_ZONE.”*  
- **To Mirror Protocol:** *“This gap in narrative may benefit from reflection. Try a Mirror?”*  
- **To Contrary Corner:** *“This tension in your argument could use sharpening. Want to test it?”*  
- **To Waiting With Mode:** *“This looks like paradox — let’s just name it and hold it.”*  

---

## Failure Modes & Counters
- **Overexposure** → counter by pacing: not every fracture needs surfacing now.  
- **Misfire (wrong routing)** → counter by rerouting or marking “unclear.”  
- **Paralysis (endless waiting)** → counter by honest check: “Am I waiting because it’s paradox, or avoiding?”  

---

## Field Test Note
1. **Log 3 Fractures:**  
   - One relational, one framing tension, one paradox/aporia.  
2. **Test Modes:**  
   - Route one to a tool (e.g., RELATION_ZONE).  
   - Hold one in **Waiting With Mode**.  
3. **Observe:**  
   - Did **naming** the fracture change its pull?  
   - Did **Waiting With Mode** reduce anxiety around the paradox?  

---

## Ecosystem Role
Fracture Finder is diagnostic glue in PoTM. It:  
- **Links** contradictions to specific protocols.  
- **Preserves tone** to maintain safety.  
- **Introduces paradox-holding** as dignified practice.  

---

## Versioning & Lineage
