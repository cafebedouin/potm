Recap: Detect tool limits and choose the safe path.

Step 1: Can you open 3 links (README, /core/axioms, /experimental/example)? Report success/failure.
If any fail: Operate only inside Boot Pack/Primer; do not follow links.
If all pass: You may follow links, but prefer manifest text as ground truth.
Always ask if a referenced file is missing from current context.
